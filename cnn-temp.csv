Polls say Americans report record low opinions of China. Are the surveys measuring racism?,26/3/2021,"In fact, if you go by the polls, they've never liked it less.
But what does that even mean?
When asked how they felt toward China, the vast majority of Americans surveyed required no further detail before giving definitive answers like ""very cold"" and ""very unfavorable,"" according to results published by Gallup and Pew, two leading public opinion research groups, this month.   
Every few months, another mainstream, widely respected group publishes Americans' answers to some version of this very broad question. In October, the Chicago Council on Global Affairs published results from their version of the so-called ""feeling thermometer"" question, allowing responses on a 100-point scale ranging from a ""very warm, favorable feeling"" of 100 to a ""very cold, unfavorable"" feeling of zero. Nearly 1,200 Americans came back with an average response that was, well, freezing at 32.
In a national context that sees Asian Americans harassed and assaulted because of their ethnicity, and where then President Donald Trump's use of the term ""Chinese virus"" was linked to increases in racist online rhetoric, some observers are wishing that the questions Americans ask to understand themselves allow for more nuance.
""It's not possible to treat China like this one, coherent thing. As if you can hold positive or negative attitudes towards the government, all the people, the culture -- and that all sticks together as one single opinion,"" said Tobita Chow, director of Justice is Global. Across the US media spectrum, China is a subject of constant interest. It is depicted as partner, competitor, and enemy, but it's never ignored.
In this climate, Chenchen Zhang, lecturer of Politics and International Relations at Queen's University Belfast, says the ""feeling thermometer"" questions used in surveys about China are different. ?Mainstream pollsters ""wouldn't ask Americans this question about Denmark or Italy, because no one would know who the prime ministers there are, or what the policies of the ruling parties are,"" she said.  

""And (Americans) don't know the Chinese policies either, but they know that there is a Communist party, and it's not good. I think that makes opinion surveys about China different from other nations,"" Zhang said.  
""There's a lot of pressure and encouragement for people to engage in thinking about China that's either black or white; good or evil. It is exceptionally hard to get people to think of China in a more nuanced way,"" Chow said. ""It's worth asking: are there different ways we can check people's attitudes?""
China as a monolith 
Whether it's the pernicious model minority myth or the alarming spike in xenophobic language being used to harass people of Asian descent, one of the defining features of the racism Asian Americans experience is being treated as a monolith, community advocates say.
And with the outsized presence of China in the American imagination, it is a frustratingly common experience for people who have nothing to do with China to be presumed ""Chinese"" on the basis of their name or appearance.  Loyalties are questioned. Crude stereotypes are assumed.  
And among those who pay close attention to the politics and culture of China, the extremes can be dizzying in a way that is difficult to quantify in a single word or ""temperature.""
Chow says important distinctions get lost in the possible survey answers of ""favorable"" and ""unfavorable.""  
""What do you think about the state of the country right now, and what do you wish for the country? I have an unfavorable view about a lot of what is happening in US society right now, but at the same time I want things to get better for the US and everyone in it. I suspect that 'unfavorability' applied to China fails to make this distinction, and runs these things together: thinking that the other country has a lot of problems right now and wanting things to go poorly for them in the future.""
Decades in use, historic findings 
But academics who study and design polls say that these questions offer valuable insight into how opinions have changed over time. 
""The reason we keep using these feeling thermometer questions is because they've been asked for so long,"" said Samara Klar, a political scientist at the University of Arizona.  
""There's a trade-off,"" Klar says, ""if you change the question, then you lose the time series, and you can't really compare it to any previous surveys. So it is really valuable to have them, partially because we've been asking them for decades. And if you're seeing these trends become more and more negative, that's definitely telling you something.""
In the year of the coronavirus pandemic, these trends have reached historically negative levels.   
In the survey conducted by Ipsos - KnowledgePanel for the Chicago Council in July 2020, Americans responded with the lowest ""temperature"" they'd reported since the council began asking the question in 1978.
In a Gallup poll conducted early last month, 79% of Americans surveyed reported an unfavorable view of China. It was by far the highest percentage Gallup had reported since September 1979.
In a Pew survey also from ?last summer, 42% of Americans surveyed reported a ""very unfavorable"" opinion of China. It was by far the highest percentage Pew had observed since it began asking the question in the spring of 2005.  
These findings were reported widely, often as little more than splashy headlines and tweets.  
Feelings about the self and the other 
To Klar, the historically negative results may be a function, in part, of the way the question was asked. 
Klar does not study China, or Americans' opinions of it. But she does use survey research to understand how Americans think about partisan politics at home, and she sees some relevant parallels in the ways ""feeling thermometer"" questions are asked of Democrats and Republicans. 
""What survey researchers have found, over the last several decades, is that people feel about the same towards their own party that they always have, but they feel more and more negative towards the other party. And this has led to this phenomenon that political scientists call affective polarization, which means people increasingly dislike members of the other party. And people are really concerned about this,"" Klar said. 
But in thinking about the ""other"" in the question, Klar and her colleagues have found that when Americans give especially negative answers, they are often thinking, specifically, about the elites of the other party.  
Perhaps anticipating the public's curiosity, Pew published a companion piece to its latest survey, explaining what Americans were thinking about when they reported their views of ""China."" Similar to Klar's observation about broad questions causing respondents to imagine elites when they answer, Pew reported that ""Americans rarely brought up the Chinese people or the country's long history and culture in their responses.  Instead, they focused primarily on the Chinese government.""  
On the subject of the Chinese government, Americans' views are especially negative about Chinese president Xi Jinping. Forty-three percent told Pew they had ""no confidence at all"" in Xi to ""do the right thing regarding world affairs.""
Klar says Americans polled on China might respond differently if asked narrower questions, like they do when polled on domestic partisan issues.
""When we say, 'ok, now I want you to think about the people who voted for them, or people who identify with the other party.' Then we find significantly warmer reports. So essentially, what this means is that people have very negative feelings towards the institution of (the other party) or the elites of the (other party), or maybe even that party as an abstract concept, but when we hone in on the question of ordinary voters, they actually feel quite warm towards them. Which suggests that we do tend to be colder in the abstract than we are when it comes to a person down the street."" 
Risks of misinterpretation 
So what if Americans' now-famous negativity toward China is overstated? 
Klar notes from her own research that ""the more people think that Republicans and Democrats are polarized on issues where they're not actually that polarized, the more they express negative feelings toward ?members of the other group, risking creation of a vicious cycle.  
Stated more broadly, ""if we overstate hostility towards out groups, it tends to exacerbate subsequent hostility toward those groups,"" Klar said. 
But as Asian Americans around the country are saying loud and clear, the racialized hostility they experience is hardly overstated. 
Klar sees the risk. ""If we understate discrimination, then we are essentially dismissing a really important crisis in our country, which is that a non-White minority is being discriminated against,"" she said. 
Justin McCarthy, a spokesperson for Gallup, notes that their polls have measured large fluctuations in public opinion over the last four decades. But previous spikes in American antipathy for China have not corresponded to increased reports of xenophobic attacks against Asian Americans like this past year. 
 Diversity in design 
David Wilson, a professor of political science and international relations at the University of Delaware, says ""feeling thermometer"" questions can be effective tools for measuring a society's views, and may even help pollsters identify the kinds of views that respondents may be reluctant to admit openly. 
The American public's affect, or mood, about China, is a useful data point for researchers, Wilson says. In combination with data from other questions on things like specific foreign policy initiatives, researchers can gain valuable insight into the public's behavior. 
But Wilson notes that what the general public considers to be an appropriate survey question can change over time. So can the makeup of that public, itself. 
Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial group in the United States, according to Pew, and their voices have been reflected in these polls in increasing numbers. But according to Wilson, there has been relatively little focus in the survey design world on how Asian Americans perceive questions. ""It's a legitimate concern to know how they're interpreting the questions,"" he said. 
""Most questions have been standardized on White Americans. America is probably the leading country in terms of surveys and public opinion work, and, on average, the overwhelming majority of every sample is White people. So most of the questions we've been tracking over time just disregard the racial sensitivities of other groups,"" Wilson said. 
How can researchers accommodate for the ways different people may perceive a question?
For me, it's diversifying the survey room so you can have the tough conversations with each other, and vet the survey. Vet the conversation before you give it to the public,"" he said, about his hopes for the industry as a whole.
The view from the survey room 
Dina Smeltz is a senior fellow for public opinion and foreign policy at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, and a member of the team that designed their October 2020 survey. She says the survey's questions offer an important way ""to gauge the ups and downs"" of a relationship like the one between the US and China, and the public's reactions to it. 
""I don't think this is normalizing animus, it is measuring a snapshot of public opinion at a particular point in time. The thermometer is an especially neutral way to ask about a country,"" she said. 
But she notes that there can be big differences between views of a country and views of its people.  
""In a perfect world, research organizations would be able to ask a full range of questions about the Chinese government, the Chinese economy, the positives they associate with China, the negatives they associate with China, and then move on to ask about the Chinese people, the positives and negatives associated with the Chinese people, and from there break it down even further,"" Smeltz said. 
""If we had the room and the budget to ask deeper questions about various groups of people within China, those indicators would, of course, add a richer understanding of American attitudes toward China and the Chinese people. Hopefully we will be funded to do that in the future."" 
McCarthy defends his organization's current approach. ""At Gallup we are fortunate to have powerful tools at our disposal to accurately measure public opinion, and to have trends that provide unparalleled context for current attitudes. It is our responsibility to maintain these trends and to provide expert analysis explaining them. Selectively choosing not to measure certain things out of fear of how the results may be misinterpreted or misused would be a dangerous and slippery slope. Rather, we would encourage all who want to improve society to look to reliable data like Gallup's to understand public attitudes and work from there to press for policy or societal changes as needed."" 
Laura Silver, senior researcher at Pew, said ""we agree that it's important to be clear what people are thinking about when they respond to questions like our feeling thermometers,"" and noted that, this year, Pew asked a question to try to uncover that. 
""Our results show that when Americans described what they thought about China, they rarely brought up the Chinese people or the country's long history and culture in their responses. Instead, they focused primarily on the Chinese government -- including its policies or how it behaves internationally -- as well as its economy."" 
","This year, Americans said they really, really don't like China.   In fact, if you go by the polls, they've never liked it less. But what does that even mean?

"At funeral of Georgia spa shooting victim, ex-husband says her relatives think US isn't safe. 'And who could blame them?'",27/3/2021,"And if Americans could learn from her example, ""the violence and bloodshed might stop,"" her ex-husband said at the service.
A funeral Mass was celebrated on Friday for Tan, the 49-year-old owner of one of three spas where a gunman went on a rampage March 16.
Tan and her daughter moved from China to the US with her then-husband Michael Webb more than 15 years ago. On Friday, Webb told mourners that Tan's family abroad would like her now-adult daughter, an American citizen, to live in China ""because they think it's just not safe here anymore.""
""And who could blame them?"" Webb said at the service at Catholic Church of St. Ann in Marietta, northwest of Atlanta. ""This is the kind of example our country is setting for the rest of the world.""
When the Georgia shootings were followed days later by a massacre at a Colorado grocery store, Webb said, he heard a reporter say something about US mass shootings having largely paused during the coronavirus pandemic, until now.
""Do we really have to quarantine ourselves to avoid being gunned down in the grocery store, our schools, our businesses, our places of worship?"" Webb said. ""We as a country should be ashamed.
""If only our country could learn from Xiaojie's example, the violence and bloodshed and pain might stop.""

She saved 'for the retirement that would never come'
Tan, owner of Youngs Asian Massage in Georgia's Cherokee County, was killed two days before her 50th birthday.
Webb, one of two people who eulogized her, met Tan in China while he was there on business in 2003, and they married the next year.
When they moved to Florida, she was determined to own her own business.
She enrolled in school to get a license to be a nail technician while they lived in Florida, he has said. They later moved to Georgia in 2008, where she bought a nail salon in Marietta and ran it for 10 years.
Tan eventually sold that business, and bought and ran two spas, including Youngs Asian Massage, the Cherokee County business where she would lose her life.
With her earnings, she bought a home for her mother in China, put her daughter through college and saved for a future where she'd hoped to travel to places like Alaska and Europe.
""She worked six days (a week), sometimes seven, 12 hours a day -- usually eating rice and vegetables in the back of her shop for lunch and dinner, to save money for the retirement that would never come,"" Webb said at Friday's service.
Tan looked after her employees, helping some start their own businesses, the Rev. Ray Cadran said during the Mass, citing her family.
Webb added that ""her customers became her friends, and she would always bring them gifts -- her homemade dumplings -- which she would share with the neighboring businesses.""
Jin Jin, of the Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs group, eulogized Tan on behalf of the Asian American community and her family and friends in China.
""She was like many of us: first-generation immigrant, intelligent, hardworking, and always kind to others. Loved to serve the community,"" Jin Jin said.
""Xiaojie is one of us. She is a good daughter, mother, sister, friend, and a neighbor,"" she said. ""She will forever live in our heart.""
Those attending Friday's service included several state lawmakers, as well as staff from the offices of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, US Sens. Raphael Warnock and John Ossoff, and US Rep. Carolyn Bourdeaux.
Tan's daughter, Jamie Webb, told CNN last week that she been looking forward to celebrating her mom's 50th birthday -- a celebration stolen by her death.
""I just want to hold her tight,"" Jamie Webb said last week. 'Give her a hug ... hold her hand, hug her for a long time.""
A GoFundMe page set up to support Jamie Webb has raised more than $90,000.

Travel to Hawaii during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go,26/3/2021,,"If you're planning to travel to Hawaii, here's what you'll need to know and expect if you want to visit during the Covid-19 pandemic. The basics Hawaii reopened to visitors from within the United States and a small number of countries in October, but visitors must provide evidence of a negative Covid-19 test result.  All air passengers entering the United States must now present a negative test result. See below for details on which tests types are approved specifically for the state of Hawaii, including for Americans arriving from other states. What's on offer Spectacular surfing, sandy beaches, traditional Pacific culture and rugged volcanoes -- including the ongoing eruption of Kilauea. You can get daily updates on volcanic activity from the US Geological Survey here. Hawaii's geographical position and proud history make it unlike anywhere else in the United States.  Who can go Travelers from the United States, Canada, Japan and South Korea are allowed to bypass Hawaii's mandatory 10-day quarantine on most islands by following strict pre-travel testing rules (see below).  Beyond those countries, Hawaii is following CDC guidelines, meaning those who have been in Brazil, China, the European Schengen Area, Iran, Ireland, South Africa and the United Kingdom in the past 14 days will be denied entry. Travelers from all other countries must undergo a 10-day quarantine. Check the Safe Travels Hawai'i site for details as the situation evolves.  All tourists must also complete a Safe Travels Hawaii form and many will need to undergo a health screening on arrival. Alaska Airlines, United Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines and Southwest Airlines have created preclearance programs allowing passengers on many flights to show their test results before departure and bypass the airport document screening process in Hawaii. Japan Airlines also recently added a preclearance program, and All Nippon Airways is adding one soon, according to Hawaii officials. Travelers on select flights on Delta Air Lines and United Airlines from Los Angeles (LAX) to Honolulu (HNL) can enroll and use CLEAR's Health Pass to securely link their test results to their verified identity before traveling. What are the restrictions? Hawaii's travel restrictions are evolving rapidly.  Currently, all travelers must either undergo a 10-day quarantine or -- if traveling from a handful of countries (listed above) to any island other than Kauai -- avoid quarantine by presenting a negative test from a ""trusted partner,"" a list of which can be found on Hawaii Covid-19 website.  For air travelers entering Hawaii from abroad, getting a specific type of test -- a Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) -- from one of Hawaii's approved Trusted Testing Partners will be particularly important because some tests accepted under the new US testing requirement that went into effect on January 26 would not allow travelers to bypass Hawaii's quarantine. Test results must be uploaded to the Safe Travels Hawaii site before your flight to the islands. Showing a negative test on arrival in Hawaii is no longer sufficient and you will incur the 10-day quarantine. There is a mandatory contact tracing requirement for all travelers from both the mainland and interisland to Maui. All travelers to Maui have to download the AlohaSafe Alert app on their mobile phones. If you don't, you'll have to go into a mandatory 10-day quarantine.  Visitors who have been in the state of Hawaii for more than three days may visit Kauai without quarantining by complying with a number of measures including a test more than three days after arriving in the state but within 72 hours before traveling to Kauai. Kauai has a shortened three-day quarantine option for travelers arriving from out of state who participate in a""resort bubble"" program. However, Kauai recently rejoined the Safe Travels Hawaii program. Effective April 5, it will be unnecessary for Kauai's out-of-state visitors to stay in a resort bubble or spend time on another Hawaiian island to get a quarantine exemption. Until then, visitors must still follow the current system. Registration with Safe Travels Hawaii as soon as flights are booked is mandatory for all travelers older than 18. The form will generate a unique QR code that must be scanned on arrival. Negative tests must be uploaded here, and a questionnaire must be completed 24 hours ahead of travel. The Safe Travels program randomly invites travelers to participate in a voluntary secondary test three to four days after arrival. What's the Covid situation? With only about 29,000 cases and 457 deaths as of March 26, Hawaii has seen relatively low Covid numbers compared with other US states. Strict lockdown measures were put in place in March 2020 to ensure that the islands were not overwhelmed. What can visitors expect? Restrictions vary by island, although there is a statewide mask mandate -- they must be worn whenever out in public. Oahu has implemented a four-tier system of restrictions. It's now in Tier 3 (Tier 4 is the least restrictive).  This means increased numbers in social gatherings are allowed -- from no more than five people previously, to now no more than 10. Other new relaxed allowances: -- Groups of 10 people are allowed in restaurants regardless of household or living unit, and the capacity limit of 50% of legal occupancy is gone. -- Commercial recreational boating is allowed up to 50% capacity. -- Helicopter tours, plane tours and skydiving are allowed with groups of up to 10 people. -- Bars are allowed to to serve alcohol until midnight. Maui, Molokai and Lanai -- all in Maui County -- allow for gatherings of up to five people. Beaches and Maui County Parks are open. On Hawaii Island, outdoor gatherings of up to 25 people are permitted as long as masks are worn and social distancing rules followed. Indoor gatherings are limited to 10 people. Beaches are open. Kauai has amended its quarantine rules (see above). It is currently in Tier 4, meaning gatherings of 10 people are allowed indoors and 25 outdoors. Restaurants and bars are open but limited to 50% capacity indoors.

Travel to New York City during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go,26/3/2021,,"If you're planning to travel to New York City, here's what you'll need to know and expect if you want to visit during the Covid-19 pandemic. The basics New York City was the US epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, with hospitals struggling to cope with the influx of patients.  After an easier summer, it experienced a rise of infections at the end of 2020 into January and new lockdown measures were imposed. Those numbers have dropped substantially, though researchers have reported a disturbing new variant of the coronavirus in the city. What's on offer This is the ultimate city break. New York has the greatest city skyline in the world; culture from the Guggenheim to MoMA; spectacular food, from Chinese delicacies in Flushing to Italian delights in the Bronx; and the green sweep of Central Park to the busy Lower East Side.  Who can go New York is subject to US government rules, meaning travel from Brazil, China, the European Schengen Area, Iran, Ireland, South Africa and the United Kingdom is not permitted. Exemptions are available for US citizens, family members or permanent residents. Travel from all other countries is allowed. All air travelers entering the United States are now required to have a negative Covid-19 test result. Travelers from out of state are allowed into New York State, with some restrictions (see below). What are the restrictions? New York has stringent measures for those traveling domestically and internationally.  Travelers from states contiguous to New York are exempt from quarantine or testing requirements but must fill out the state's Traveler Health Form. Full instructions can be found on the Covid-19 travel advisory site.  Travelers from other states are allowed into New York state but currently are required to quarantine for 10 days or use a testing regimen to shorten quarantine. To shorten it, a Covid-19 PCR test must be taken within three days before arrival with a negative result, travelers must then quarantine for three days, then take a second test with a negative result.  However, domestic travelers will no longer be required to quarantine after entering New York from another US state or territory starting April 1, although the health department still recommends quarantine after domestic travel as an added precaution. Domestic travelers from other states who have been fully vaccinated within the past 90 days no longer have to test and quarantine.  Mandatory quarantines will remain in effect for international travelers after April 1. All travelers must continue to fill out the state's Traveler Health Form.  Every air traveler entering the US needs a negative Covid-19 test result. Passengers are required to get a viral test within three days before their flight to the US departs, and to provide documentation of their lab results or documentation of having recovered from Covid-19. What's the Covid situation? After months of falling daily cases in New York City, the number of infections started to climb again in the autumn of 2020, with a record high in early January before starting to decline again. More than 30,000 total confirmed and probable deaths, and 824,000 total confirmed or probable cases, were registered as of March 26. What can visitors expect? New York's busy streets fell quiet at the start of the pandemic and recovery has been slow in the months since, although many areas, including Brooklyn, are busy again.  On March 22, capacity for outdoor gatherings increased to 25 people. The limit for indoor gatherings will remain at 10 people. For social gatherings in public spaces, capacity limits for indoor events have increased to 100 people and outdoor event capacity is now at 200 people. Social distancing and mask requirements remain for gatherings. Starting April 2, venues for events, arts and entertainment will be allowed to reopen at 33% capacity, capped at 100 people indoors and 200 people outdoors. If there's attendee testing, capacity will increase to 150 people indoors and 500 people outdoors -- with distancing and face covering requirements. Indoor dining expanded to 50% capacity on March 19. Outdoor dining continues, with restaurants and bars building ad hoc structures. Bars and restaurants must close at 11 p.m. Museums are open, but have started mandating timed reservations, in a bid to comply with lower capacity rules. MoMA, the Museum of Natural History and the Whitney are all operating a policy of prebought tickets only. Visitors should expect temperature checks on arrival. Nonessential retail is open. Masks are mandatory in public, however, and social distancing guidelines must be adhered to at all times.

China slaps duties of up to 218% on Australian wine for 5 years,26/3/2021,"The duties, which range from 116% to 218%, were announced Friday and come after an investigation by Chinese authorities found instances of ""dumping and [market] damage."" They take effect on Sunday.
Australian Grape & Wine Chief Executive Tony Battaglene told Bloomberg Friday that the industry group will likely recommend making a complaint to the World Trade Organization. China was, until recently, the largest market for exports of Australian wine.
Relations between Australia and China began to deteriorate last April after Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for an international investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. A number of Australian exports ！ including timber, beef and some types of coal ！ soon began to encounter difficulties entering the Chinese market.
Chinese investment in Australia plunged to just over 1 billion Australian dollars ($763 million) in 2020, down 62% from the previous year, according to a report released earlier this month by the Australian National University's Chinese Investment in Australia Database.
Australia's wine industry has been at the center of the storm. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce imposed temporary tariffs of up to 212% on Australian wine imports in November following an anti-dumping investigation.
The value of exports of wine to China dropped to almost zero in December, according to statistics from industry group Wine Australia.

Hundreds of US families have been trying for a year to adopt children from China. They're still waiting,26/3/2021,"But their laughs on the swings and shrieks on the trampoline belie a deep sense of sadness -- because one person is missing. It's now been a year since they had their bags packed and hotels booked for a trip to China to adopt their sixth child, a 7-year-old named Penelope. 
Then, the coronavirus pandemic hit. 

A weekslong delay turned into months as, by early March 2020, China suspended the country's foreign adoption program. One year later, they are still stuck in limbo.
""Every time I go into her room and just see her pink bed there, that no one has slept in and the drawers full of clothes that have probably been outgrown before they could ever be worn,"" Aimee Welch told CNN's Poppy Harlow, ""it's just a heartbreaking reality."" 
According to the State Department, about 400 American families' adoptions of children in China were put on hold because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
'A new way of looking at the world'
Aimee and Stephen Welch are now also preparing to raise their daughters -- and sons -- as reports of acts anti-Asian hate spike in the United States. 
Over the last year, Asian Americans have been the targets of verbal and physical assaults. Many Asian groups have blamed the climate of hate and fear on the rhetoric of former President Donald Trump, who referred to Covid-19 as the ""China virus"" or ""kung flu.""
Between March and December 2020, 2,808 complaints were reported to Stop AAPI Hate. The nonprofit organization, which tracks racist encounters reported by Asian Americans, says some 9% of those incidents involved physical assaults and 71% included verbal harassment.
""We're a transracial family,"" Stephen Welch said. ""And so figuring out what that looks like and how to help our daughters grow up in a society where right now there is antagonism and microaggressions and things that I might not have previously been aware of, the situation forces kind of a new way of looking at the world.""
""We really want this to be an ongoing effort because it's not just that we are bringing children from China into our home, but we're committed to being in a Chinese American family,"" Aimee Welch said. 
""We want to have that lens where we don't just have a few Chinese decorations in their bedroom, but this is something that imbues our family. And we want to honor and celebrate where they come from, as well as where they're going.""
Families face devastating consequences
For some families, the wait means devastating consequences. 
That includes a family living in Massachusetts that was supposed to adopt a 3-year-old girl with severe medical issues from China in January 2020.
Their adopted daughter was born with a condition known as arthrogryposis, which in her case has led to clubfeet. 
Now 5 years old, she's not yet able to walk, and is in desperate need of the occupational and physical therapy she would receive in the United States, according to her would-be adoptive parents. 
""We definitely have seen a decline over the last two years based on photos we've seen,"" her adoptive mother tells CNN. ""I don't know if anyone is even moving her. I don't know if anyone is standing her on her legs ... We've really seen her plateau and even a regression.""
""In all these pictures recently, she just looks so sad,"" she added. 
Even for families without as dire medical issues, the wait is likely only compounding the trauma these adopted children are facing. 
""I often think, (how does) a 6-year-old, now 7-year-old ... process something like that?"" Stephen Welch told Harlow. 
""She knows we're coming. She draws pictures of a house with mommy and daddy written on it. My heart aches to just think through how is she processing it, right? The parental instinct wants to comfort and reach out and assure (but) we're worlds apart."" 
The trauma extends to the children 
The trauma and disappointment extends to their children stateside as well. Seventeen-year-old Zachary Welch should have enjoyed one last year at home with his new sister Penelope before leaving for college.
""Missing out on that time with her has been disappointing because I want to be able to be present in my siblings' lives and it feels a little bit like that's been taken away because we've lost that time together,"" he said.
Penelope may not even come home before Zachary moves out. 
Even little 4-year-old Grace, exuberant and energetic, understands some of what is happening to her future big sister. ""She's still in China! Some people are sick and we can't go on the plane,"" she told Harlow. 
In a February 2021 letter to families, the Chinese government said foreign adoptions are suspended due to Covid-19, but did not provide any information on when they might resume.
""Before resuming adoption registration, we will actively cooperate with local civil affairs departments and child welfare agencies by the rehabilitation needs of adoptive families,"" the letter said. 
The US State Department told CNN they ""have made clear"" to China ""the importance of resuming intercountry adoptions as a high priority and as soon as health conditions allow."" The department said it is committed to working with China to find a solution.
The Chinese government did not respond to CNN's requests for additional comment. 
'We're not blaming China'
Aimee and Stephen Welch have been advocating for their cause with other waiting families by writing letters to their congressman and senators.
""We're not blaming China for wanting to be cautious,"" Stephen Welch said. ""But for these children that don't have families, the benefits of moving forward outweigh the risks.""
Aimee Welch said this should be a win-win situation for the US and China. 
""This is not a hard issue. This is an issue where everyone is on the same page that we want these children to land in families. It's just a matter of getting it done,"" she said.      
In the meantime, the Welch family -- separated by an ocean -- are making the most of their time waiting. In China, Penelope is taking English lessons, while 10-year-old Caleb Welch is taking Mandarin online in New Jersey. 
","On a gorgeous spring afternoon, Aimee and Stephen Welch are playing with their five kids in their sun-drenched New Jersey backyard, taking a break from the grind of virtual schooling and working from home.

WeWork is finally going public through a SPAC,26/3/2021,"WeWork announced Friday morning that is merging with BowX Acquisition, a blank check firm known as a SPAC, in a deal that values the office sharing company at $9 billion. Shares of BowX were up more than 10% in early trading.
WeWork was once valued at $47 billion, making it one of the most valuable unicorn startups in the world. 
But the company shelved plans for an initial public offering in 2019 after questions about corporate governance emerged, eventually leading to the ouster of controversial co-founder and CEO Adam Neumann. Neumann is reportedly now set to get about a $500 million settlement as a golden parachute from SoftBank, WeWork's top investor. 
SoftBank wound up taking an even bigger stake in WeWork as part of a bailout package. 
WeWork will be receiving about $1.3 billion in cash as part of the deal to help fund future growth plans, the company said in a press release about the SPAC.
A big chunk of that ！ $800 million ！ will come from an A-list group of investors that includes venture capital firm Insight Partners, real estate leader Starwood Capital Group, and investing giants Fidelity and BlackRock (BLK). (Insight's Deven Parekh is also joining the board.)
WeWork added that its business has held up reasonably well during the past year, even though many companies haven't been using office space as more employees work from home during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The company also said it had exited more than 100 underperforming locations as of December 2020. Large businesses now account for about half of its customers, up significantly from 10% in 2015. WeWork has also shifted more of its members to longer-term leases as opposed to monthly commitments.
WeWork's 2020 sales, excluding China, were flat compared to 2019 at $3.2 billion. (WeWork sold a majority stake in its China business last year.) It has a pipeline of $4 billion in sales for 2021, with an estimated $1.5 billion of that as already committed revenue.
Current CEO Sandeep Mathrani, a real estate veteran who joined the company a year ago, will remain CEO and SoftBank's Marcelo Claure will stay on as executive chairman.
""WeWork has spent the past year transforming the business and refocusing its core, while simultaneously managing and innovating through a historic downturn,"" Mathrani said in the release.  ""As a result, WeWork has emerged as the global leader in flexible space with a value proposition that is stronger than ever.""
BowX's Vivek Ranadiv└, a former software executive who also owns the NBA's Sacramento Kings, is joining the WeWork board. (NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal, who also works for CNN parent WarnerMedia's Turner Sports division, is a BowX advisor too.)
The WeWork transaction is the latest in a flurry of SPACs that have brought private companies to Wall Street in the past two years. 
Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic (SPCE), Bill Gates-backed electric vehicle battery maker QuantumScape and sports betting giant DraftKings have all gone public through blank check mergers.

Autopsy of a pandemic: 6 doctors at the center of the US Covid-19 response,26/3/2021,"Watch, ""COVID WAR: The Pandemic Doctors Speak Out,"" at 9 p.m. Sunday, March 28, only on CNN.
Over the period of a few weeks, in Houston, Washington, DC, and Baltimore, our team secured nondescript, large hotel ballrooms with plenty of space and ventilation to allow these extraordinary one-on-one conversations to take place with Dr. Deborah Birx, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Brett Giroir, Dr. Stephen Hahn, Dr. Robert Kadlec and Dr. Robert Redfield.
Given our shared medical backgrounds, I explained to each of the doctors that I was going to frame the discussions in a way that would be tough, but familiar: as an autopsy. 
We were going to meticulously dissect and discuss how the United States became home to the worst Covid-19 outbreak on the planet.
There is no question an autopsy or post mortem is painful and gruesome to witness. And, it does nothing for the deceased patient on the table -- in this case, the nearly 550,000 Americans who have died from Covid-19. And, yet we do it because there are often important lessons to learn; lessons that can still be applied during this ongoing pandemic and for future pandemics, which all of the doctors agree is inevitable. Autopsies are particularly important if the death was thought to have been preventable. 
And here again, the doctors were in agreement -- while Covid-19 is a serious disease, the vast majority of deaths in the United States could've been avoided.
Most of the doctors I interviewed are household names nowadays, but you have probably only previously heard them in soundbites or seen them briefly at the lectern in the White House briefing room. All but one of the doctors are private citizens now, unbridled and unrestrained by the watchful eyes of the White House, and they had a lot to say. Our cathartic and frank discussions lasted hours on end, covered a wide range of topics and were at times horrifying in what they revealed.  
The first cut
When I met up with Dr. Robert Redfield on a snowy February day in Baltimore, his mood was both reflective and determined.  A trained virologist, Redfield was tapped by President Donald Trump back in 2018 to lead the CDC after a long career in public health. Before the pandemic, the new director had been largely focused on two other epidemics: opioids and HIV/AIDS. Alongside his colleagues Fauci and Birx, Redfield has been best known for decades for his work as one of the world's leading AIDS researchers.  
As with his term as CDC director, Redfield's earlier career had not been without controversy. In the '80s and '90s, as one of the Army's top AIDS researchers, he was accused of overselling the effectiveness of a possible AIDS vaccine, though Redfield stood by his work. During the Covid-19 pandemic, critics argued Redfield failed to protect the credibility of the massive scientific agency he was tasked to lead and was outmaneuvered by an executive branch found to be meddling in science-based CDC guidance involving school closings and religious gatherings. Redfield dismissed those concerns, however. When I asked him if he felt prepared for the job, he told me, ""I think I trained my whole life for this."" 
When we sat down to talk, just days after his successor, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, had taken the helm at the CDC, Redfield wanted to start at the beginning: China. 
While every doctor harbored deep suspicions about the information initially coming from China, Redfield was the most vocal about it. He believes the current pandemic began in Wuhan as a localized outbreak in September or October of 2019 -- much earlier than the official timeline -- and then spread to every province in China over the next couple of months. The United States wasn't formally notified of the ""mysterious cluster of pneumonia patients"" until December 31, 2019. Those were critical weeks and months that countries around the world could've been preparing. 
""So they had about a 30 day head start,"" Kadlec affirmed days before I sat down with Redfield. 
Kadlec was the HHS assistant secretary for preparedness and response, known as the ASPR. ""They were already buying things on the market well in advance of what we were,"" he told me. ""Even things that were made here in the United States, we found that the domestic supplies were drying up because of foreign purchases."" 
And while the rest of the world was told the only initial Covid-19 cases in China had originated from a wet market in Wuhan, Redfield is confident the evidence suggests that was simply not the case. According to Redfield, even his counterpart at the China CDC, Dr. George Gao, was initially left in the dark about the magnitude of the problem until early January. He described a private phone call he had with Gao in early January 2020, when Gao became distraught and started crying after finding ""a lot of cases'' among individuals who had not been to the wet market.  Gao, Redfield says, ""came to the conclusion that the cat was out of the bag."" 
The initial mortality rates in China were somewhere between ""5-10%,"" Redfield told me. ""I'd probably be cryin' too,"" he added. 
One of the most significant things ""that affected our success in this pandemic was not being allowed into China"" earlier, he told me. Fauci echoed a similar sentiment when I asked him about it. 
""I think it would have been a significant difference,"" Fauci said. ""I think if we had sent our people into Wuhan and been able to talk to the Chinese scientists in a conversation that might have lasted an hour, you could have gotten so much information right from the get go. They would have told us, don't believe what you're reading. This is spread asymptomatically. It spreads highly efficiently and it's killing people.""
Neither President Trump's calls to President Xi Jinping nor Secretary Alex Azar's pleas to China's minister of health could get them in, according to Redfield. 
The question laid bare from our autopsy was, why? 
The earliest symptoms
If US investigators had been allowed into China, there is something else they may have discovered: the origins of the virus. Where and how this outbreak began is not simply an exercise of curiosity, or an attempt to assign blame. It is a necessity for scientists and public health experts around the world to try and stop future pandemics. 
So far, the official word has been that this pandemic started when the novel coronavirus was introduced through an intermediary species or jumped directly from a bat to a human, something that Redfield, the former head of the CDC, believes doesn't make ""biological sense."" 
Reminding me that his career has been spent as a virologist, he told me ""I do not believe this somehow came from a bat to a human. And at that moment in time, the virus came to the human, became one of the most infectious viruses that we know in humanity for human to human transmission ... Normally, when a pathogen goes from a zoonot to human, it takes a while for it to figure out how to become more and more efficient."" 
Without assigning intentionality, Redfield told me he believes the origin of the pandemic is a lab in China that was already studying the virus, exposing it to human cell cultures. 
""Most of us in a lab, when trying to grow a virus, we try to help make it grow better, and better, and better, and better, and better, and better so we can do experiments and figure out about it. That's the way I put it together.""  
It is a controversial, politically charged theory -- one the World Health Organization calls ""extremely unlikely,"" and there has been no clear evidence to support this ""lab leak"" theory. 
Yet, more than a year after the outbreak, a team of WHO scientists inside Wuhan has still been unable to determine the definitive origin of the virus. At this point, it is not clear they ever will.
In response to the Biden administration's call for more transparency from China about data from the earliest days of the outbreak, China released a statement out of its Washington embassy alleging that the United States is now ""pointing fingers at other countries."" Meanwhile, Chinese officials and state media have been increasingly promoting an unsubstantiated, so-called ""multiple-origin"" theory, suggesting the pandemic may have started in various locations around the world, even a US military lab. 
Final cause of death
Over nearly 20 hours of interviews, I asked each doctor the question that ends every autopsy. What do they believe was the final cause of death? What led to the preventable deaths of so many Americans?
From the role of leadership and the cost of unpreparedness to the obligations of citizens to care for one another, Redfield and the Covid doctors shared their painful lessons from the worst public health crisis of our lifetimes.
Their answers offer an illuminating and frightening glimpse into what exactly happened over the past year, and also a plan for how to handle the next one. 
""As bad as this was,"" Kadlec told me, ""it could be worse. And there will be another pandemic, guaranteed."" 
","This past January, just a few days after the inauguration of President Joe Biden, six of the doctors responsible for the previous administration's Covid-19 response agreed to sit down -- in strict confidence --  and talk with me about the events of the past year.  Over the period of a few weeks, in Houston, Washington, DC, and Baltimore, our team secured nondescript, large hotel ballrooms with plenty of space and ventilation to allow these extraordinary one-on-one conversations to take place with Dr. Deborah Birx, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Brett Giroir, Dr. Stephen Hahn, Dr. Robert Kadlec and Dr. Robert Redfield. Given our shared medical backgrounds, I explained to each of the doctors that I was going to frame the discussions in a way that would be tough, but familiar: as an autopsy.  We were going to meticulously dissect and discuss how the United States became home to the worst Covid-19 outbreak on the planet. There is no question an autopsy or post mortem is painful and gruesome to witness. And, it does nothing for the deceased patient on the table -- in this case, the nearly 550,000 Americans who have died from Covid-19. And, yet we do it because there are often important lessons to learn; lessons that can still be applied during this ongoing pandemic and for future pandemics, which all of the doctors agree is inevitable. Autopsies are particularly important if the death was thought to have been preventable.  And here again, the doctors were in agreement -- while Covid-19 is a serious disease, the vast majority of deaths in the United States could've been avoided. Most of the doctors I interviewed are household names nowadays, but you have probably only previously heard them in soundbites or seen them briefly at the lectern in the White House briefing room. All but one of the doctors are private citizens now, unbridled and unrestrained by the watchful eyes of the White House, and they had a lot to say. Our cathartic and frank discussions lasted hours on end, covered a wide range of topics and were at times horrifying in what they revealed.   The first cut When I met up with Dr. Robert Redfield on a snowy February day in Baltimore, his mood was both reflective and determined.  A trained virologist, Redfield was tapped by President Donald Trump back in 2018 to lead the CDC after a long career in public health. Before the pandemic, the new director had been largely focused on two other epidemics: opioids and HIV/AIDS. Alongside his colleagues Fauci and Birx, Redfield has been best known for decades for his work as one of the world's leading AIDS researchers.   As with his term as CDC director, Redfield's earlier career had not been without controversy. In the '80s and '90s, as one of the Army's top AIDS researchers, he was accused of overselling the effectiveness of a possible AIDS vaccine, though Redfield stood by his work. During the Covid-19 pandemic, critics argued Redfield failed to protect the credibility of the massive scientific agency he was tasked to lead and was outmaneuvered by an executive branch found to be meddling in science-based CDC guidance involving school closings and religious gatherings. Redfield dismissed those concerns, however. When I asked him if he felt prepared for the job, he told me, ""I think I trained my whole life for this.""  When we sat down to talk, just days after his successor, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, had taken the helm at the CDC, Redfield wanted to start at the beginning: China.  While every doctor harbored deep suspicions about the information initially coming from China, Redfield was the most vocal about it. He believes the current pandemic began in Wuhan as a localized outbreak in September or October of 2019 -- much earlier than the official timeline -- and then spread to every province in China over the next couple of months. The United States wasn't formally notified of the ""mysterious cluster of pneumonia patients"" until December 31, 2019. Those were critical weeks and months that countries around the world could've been preparing.  ""So they had about a 30 day head start,"" Kadlec affirmed days before I sat down with Redfield.  Kadlec was the HHS assistant secretary for preparedness and response, known as the ASPR. ""They were already buying things on the market well in advance of what we were,"" he told me. ""Even things that were made here in the United States, we found that the domestic supplies were drying up because of foreign purchases.""  And while the rest of the world was told the only initial Covid-19 cases in China had originated from a wet market in Wuhan, Redfield is confident the evidence suggests that was simply not the case. According to Redfield, even his counterpart at the China CDC, Dr. George Gao, was initially left in the dark about the magnitude of the problem until early January. He described a private phone call he had with Gao in early January 2020, when Gao became distraught and started crying after finding ""a lot of cases'' among individuals who had not been to the wet market.  Gao, Redfield says, ""came to the conclusion that the cat was out of the bag.""  The initial mortality rates in China were somewhere between ""5-10%,"" Redfield told me. ""I'd probably be cryin' too,"" he added.  One of the most significant things ""that affected our success in this pandemic was not being allowed into China"" earlier, he told me. Fauci echoed a similar sentiment when I asked him about it.  ""I think it would have been a significant difference,"" Fauci said. ""I think if we had sent our people into Wuhan and been able to talk to the Chinese scientists in a conversation that might have lasted an hour, you could have gotten so much information right from the get go. They would have told us, don't believe what you're reading. This is spread asymptomatically. It spreads highly efficiently and it's killing people."" Neither President Trump's calls to President Xi Jinping nor Secretary Alex Azar's pleas to China's minister of health could get them in, according to Redfield.  The question laid bare from our autopsy was, why?  The earliest symptoms If US investigators had been allowed into China, there is something else they may have discovered: the origins of the virus.

China boycotts are a warning to Western brands,26/3/2021,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.
What's happening: The retailers face boycotts because of stands they've taken in the past against the alleged use of forced labor to produce cotton in China's western region of Xinjiang.
Dozens of Chinese celebrities have terminated contracts or said they'll cut ties with the brands, while H&M, the world's second largest clothing retailer, has been pulled from major e-commerce sites.

Investor insight: Nike shares tumbled more than 3% Thursday on Wall Street, while Adidas sank more than 6% in Frankfurt. In London, Burberry lost more than 4%. H&M's stock also slid nearly 2% in Sweden.
The outrage was triggered by a social media post from a group linked to the ruling Communist Party, which resurfaced a statement H&M made in September about reports of forced labor in Xinjiang. State media has since targeted other major brands that have previously spoken out.
Human rights groups have repeatedly accused Beijing of detaining Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in ""re-education"" camps where they're forced to make products that find their way into global tech and retail supply chains.
Recent sanctions from the United States and other Western countries over Xinjiang have sparked renewed pushback from the Chinese government, which calls the camps ""vocational training centers"" designed to combat poverty and religious extremism.
Blowback in China against companies that have spoken out on Xinjiang may pass, according to Bernstein analyst Aneesha Sherman. Shares of H&M rose 1% in early trading Friday, while Nike's stock is up roughly 1.5% in premarket trading.
But the episode is a reminder of the challenges Western brands face as they court the immense spending power of Chinese consumers.
""It's a tough position to manage, because they can't really back down on their [stances], but at the same time they want to make sure they don't abandon the Chinese customer,"" Sherman told me.
China accounted for roughly 5% of H&M's sales in 2019. Sherman estimates that figure grew to about 10% in 2020, as China's economy recovered faster from coronavirus than its home market of Europe. 
""In a year like this, even taking a 5% haircut off the top line is a big hit when H&M is trying to recover,"" Sherman said.
Luxury brands like Burberry are even more exposed, she added. Burberry listed ""any significant change to Chinese consumer spending habits"" as a key risk to sales in its most recent annual report.
Big picture: The US-China tensions that gained prominence during the Trump era haven't gone away, with the Biden administration and allies taking a hard line with Beijing. That creates challenges for Western companies that operate in the Chinese market.
""It does affect these brands,"" Sherman said. Plus, weeks like this only strengthen the hand of local competitors, which are more tapped in to regional tastes and can avoid politically-generated controversy, she noted.
This powerful oil lobby has changed its tune on a carbon tax
The oil industry's most powerful lobby announced Thursday that it will support setting a price on carbon for the first time, a significant shift that underlines intensifying pressure on Washington and business to tackle the climate crisis.
But the devil will be in the details, my CNN Business colleague Matt Egan reports. The American Petroleum Institute laid out a series of principles that must be met before the century-old group endorses a price on carbon.
Advocates of carbon pricing say it's crucial to fighting the climate crisis, since it would accelerate efforts to curb planet-warming emissions and force investors, companies and individuals to bear the cost of pollution.
But API opposed the last serious effort to impose a price on carbon in 2010. Since then, ExxonMobil, Chevron and other industry leaders have publicly backed carbon pricing ！ clearing the way for others to follow.
""This is a pretty big deal for the industry. There is broad recognition that obviously the country has to do something on climate change,"" API CEO Mike Sommers told CNN Business. ""We want to be a willing partner with the Biden administration and others in Congress who are serious about taking on this challenge.""
Still, there's skepticism among climate groups that API's change of heart will translate to its backing of meaningful legislation. 
""A statement of theoretical support for a market-based carbon price is a long way from agreeing to what will likely need to be strong, binding rules to limit fossil fuel usage [and] methane emission,"" Dylan Tanner, executive director of InfluenceMap, a think tank focused on energy and climate change, said in a statement.
WeWork is finally going public by merging with a SPAC
It's been 18 months since WeWork scrapped its plans to go public after a disastrous IPO attempt. Now the coworking space provider appears ready to try again.
The latest: The Wall Street Journal was first to report that WeWork has agreed to merge with a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.  
The merger with BowX Acquisition Corp. would value WeWork at $9 billion. That's a fraction of the $47 billion private market valuation the company fetched previously.
Remember: WeWork was plunged into crisis in 2019 as investors combed through the company's IPO paperwork, which revealed former CEO Adam Neumann's unchecked power and numerous potential conflicts of interest, as well as the startup's staggering losses.
The company was forced to postpone its IPO, accept a bailout from SoftBank and reconfigure its business.
Now, it could raise money by tapping into the SPAC boom. In recent months, investors have raced to set up so-called ""blank check"" companies, which exist purely to find private companies to merge with, effectively taking them public.
Details, details: BowX Acquisition Corp., which raised $420 million from investors last year, is led by Vivek Ranadiv└, who founded Tibco Software and now owns the Sacramento Kings. Ranadiv└ will join WeWork's board.

Chinese celebrities rush to defend Beijing's Xinjiang policy by cutting ties with international brands,26/3/2021,,"Chinese celebrities are finding it increasingly difficult to stay out of politics.  Due to China's tight restrictions on free speech, most of the country's stars have been outwardly apolitical by default. But as China embraces a new wave of apparent nationalism -- promoted by the ruling Communist Party and amplified by state media -- it seems staying silent is no longer a viable option. Over the past two days, Chinese actors, singers and models have spoken up en masse to defend Beijing's policy on Xinjiang, as a nationalist-fueled backlash erupted against some international clothing brands for expressing concerns over allegations of forced labor, and refusing to use cotton produced in the western region. Human rights groups have accused Beijing of detaining Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in internment camps across Xinjiang, and using them for forced labor, which they claim is part of global tech and retail supply chains, either directly or indirectly. Recent sanctions from the United States and other Western countries over Xinjiang have sparked a renewed pushback from the Chinese government, which calls the camps ""vocational training centers"" designed to combat terrorism and religious extremism. China has repeatedly and vehemently denied accusations of forced labor in the camps.  In December, the US government said it would block imports of cotton produced in Xinjiang over concerns it ""may have been made by slave labor in some of the most egregious human rights violations existing today.""  However, in a striking move this week, more than 30 Chinese celebrities have ended their promotional partnerships or said they would cut ties with brands they accused of ""smearing"" cotton produced in Xinjiang, including H&M, Nike, Adidas, Puma and Calvin Klein.  The stars include A-list actress Yang Mi, top pop idol Wang Yibo, Uyghur actress Dilraba Dilmurat, Hong Kong Cantopop singer Eason Chan and Taiwanese cellist Ouyang Nana. The scale of the celebrity exodus is unprecedented -- so much so that on Chinese social media, March 25 has been dubbed ""contract termination day"" among China's entertainment circles. Other celebrities also showed allegiance by sharing the hashtag ""I support Xinjiang's cotton,"" which has been viewed nearly 5 billion times since it was posted Wednesday by party mouthpiece People's Daily on Weibo, China's heavily-censored version of Twitter. The collective support from celebrities is just the latest example of the role they are expected to play in an ever more nationalistic China -- that of vocal defenders of the country's actions, even if it means sacrificing their own business opportunities.  While some of them are more than happy to speak out, either because of their genuine support for the government or the pragmatic belief that doing so could benefit their careers, others simply cannot afford to stay silent under intense online pressure and public scrutiny. 'A nation's dignity is not to be violated' The latest outrage comes after the Party's youth wing, the Communist Youth League, on Wednesday posted an old statement from H&M, about Xinjiang on Weibo. In the statement, which was released in September 2020, H&M, the world's second-largest clothing retailer, said that it was ""deeply concerned"" over reports of forced labor in the production of cotton in Xinjiang and that it had stopped buying cotton from growers in the region. In the Weibo post, the Communist Youth League denounced the company's stance. ""Spreading rumors to boycott Xinjiang cotton while trying to make a profit in China? Wishful thinking!"" it said. Actor Huang Xuan, who had been a brand ambassador for H&M since last April, announced soon after that he would no longer work with the company. Another H&M ambassador, Song Qian, followed with a similar announcement. But the public ire did not stop at H&M. Social media users found a statement from Nike, published nearly a year ago, that said it was ""concerned about reports of forced labor in, and connected to, Xinjiang."" As the outrage spread to Nike, its brand ambassador Wang Yibo came under fire for not immediately cutting ties with the company. Amid growing criticism over his silence, Wang's agency eventually announced on Thursday morning that the star had ended all cooperation with the sportswear brand.  ""Our agency and Mr. Wang resolutely resist any remark and action that smears China. A nation's dignity is not to be violated. (We) resolutely safeguard the motherland's interest,"" the statement said. Throughout Thursday, more and more celebrities followed suit, cutting ties with fashion brands linked to the Better Cotton Initiative, a non-profit group based in Geneva and London, that promotes sustainable cotton production, which said in October it was suspending its approval of cotton sourced from Xinjiang, citing human rights concerns. Political liability Partnering with famous Western brands has long been a coveted business opportunity -- they can be lucrative and help Chinese celebrities gain international clout. For the brands themselves, tapping into the world's largest luxury market via stars with followings in the millions, is good for business. But in recent years, these seemingly innocuous deals come with greater risk for stars.  In 2018, Italian luxury brand Dolce & Gabbana ignited an outcry in China after releasing promotional videos featuring an Asian model struggling to eat Italian food with chopsticks, drawing accusations of racism. To make matters worse, one of its co-founders was then accused of making derogatory remarks about Chinese people as he defended the ads in private Instagram messages (the Italian designer denied posting them, insisting his account was hacked).  Amid the outrage that followed, two of D&G's Asia Pacific brand ambassadors, singer and actor Wang Junkai and actress Dilraba Dilmurat, terminated their contracts with the luxury label. ""The motherland is absolutely not to be violated. The motherland is above everything,"" Wang's representative office said in a statement at the time. In 2019, during the height of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests, luxury fashion houses Coach, Versace and Givenchy were accused by Chinese consumers of undermining the country's sovereignty by designing T-shirts that listed Hong Kong and Macau -- China's two special administrative regions -- as countries.  Following the uproar, a slew of Chinese celebrities, including model Liu Wen and actress Yang Mi, quickly cut ties with the fashion brands. In other instances, Chinese stars have been affected by politics as a result of direct orders from the Chinese government. In 2019, China's film regulator blocked the mainland's movie industry from participating in Taiwan's Golden Horse awards, dubbed the ""Chinese-language Oscars,"" amid rising tensions between Beijing and the self-ruled democratic island. The ban came after the event, stirred questions about Taiwan's independence in late 2018, when a Taiwanese best documentary winner said she hoped the territory would ""one day be treated as a genuine independent entity."" Top image: Dilraba Dilmurat arrives at the red carpet of 2019 Tencent Star Awards on December 28, 2019 in Beijing, China. Her agency stated that she decided to cut ties with Adidas on Thursday.

H&M and Nike are facing a boycott in China over Xinjiang cotton statements,26/3/2021,"H&M and Nike (NKE) said months ago they were concerned about allegations forced labor has been used to produce cotton in Xinjiang, but they've now been caught in an escalating firestorm that has erupted on Chinese social media this week.
Swedish multinational H&M, the world's second-largest clothing retailer, has been pulled from major e-commerce stores in China and blocked by several major navigation, review and rating apps. Videos are circulating on social media that a shopping mall in Chengdu, Sichuan province has removed H&M's advertising sign outside the mall. 
Nike and Adidas (ADDDF), among other brands, have also faced heavy criticism. Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily on Thursday named the two firms along with Burberry, New Balance, and other members of the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) that have expressed concerns about cotton produced in Xinjiang. The paper then called for broad boycotts of the brands. 
Dozens of Chinese celebrities have terminated contracts or said they would cut ties with these brands, including Nike, Adidas, Puma, Converse, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and Uniqlo ！ a move lauded by state media. And Honor of Kings, Tencent's smash-hit video game, is ending a partnership with Burberry (BBRYF) and removing its tartan design from characters' outfits.
Nike shares tumbled more than 3% Thursday on Wall Street, while Adidas sank more than 6%. In London, Burberry lost more than 4%. H&M stock also slid nearly 2% in Sweden.

The outrage comes after a group linked to the ruling Communist Party posted a statement from H&M about Xinjiang on Chinese social media site Weibo. In the statement, released in September, H&M said it was ""deeply concerned"" over reports of forced labor in the production of cotton in Xinjiang.
Human rights groups have repeatedly accused Beijing of detaining Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in the region in ""re-education"" camps and using them as forced labor, which they claim is part of global tech and retail supply chains, either directly or indirectly. 
Recent sanctions from the United States and other Western countries over Xinjiang have sparked a renewed pushback from the Chinese government, which calls the camps ""vocational training centers"" designed to combat poverty and religious extremism. 
In a viral social media post about H&M, China's Communist Youth League denounced the company's stance.
""Spreading rumors to boycott Xinjiang cotton, while trying to make a profit in China? Wishful thinking!"" the post said.
H&M faced a barrage of criticism from Chinese social media users, while Weibo posts containing the hashtag ""I support Xinjiang cotton"" racked up more than 4 billion views. ""H&M clothes are rags,"" one of the most-liked Weibo comments said. ""They don't deserve our Xinjiang cotton!""
Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba (BABA) and JD.com (JD) even removed all H&M products from sale following the backlash. 
People's Daily voiced its outrage at H&M, saying on its official Weibo account: ""China's Xinjiang cotton is white and flawless."" State broadcaster CCTV accused foreign brands of ""earning big profits in China but attacking the country with lies at the same time.""
Actor Huang Xuan and actress Song Qian, brand ambassadors for H&M since last year, said separately they would no longer work with the company.
In a statement posted Wednesday on Weibo, H&M said it has always maintained high standards and transparency in its global supply chain. 
""[This] does not represent any political position ... H&M Group always respects Chinese consumers. We are committed to long-term investment and development in China,"" the statement said. The company added it was working with ""more than 350 manufacturers"" in China. H&M declined a request from CNN Business for additional comment.
Within hours, the criticism had spread to Nike. The company had said nearly a year ago it was ""concerned about reports of forced labor in, and connected to, Xinjiang."" 
""Nike does not source products from [Xinjiang] and we have confirmed with our contract suppliers that they are not using textiles or spun yarn from the region,"" the statement said.
Soon after the Nike statement began circulating on Weibo this week, Chinese singer and actor Wang Yibo said he had cut ties with the US company and ""firmly opposes any remarks and actions that smear China."" Nike did not respond to a request from CNN Business for comment.
Over the past year, a number of Western companies have said they will examine their global supply chains to ensure they are free from Xinjiang cotton products after allegations of forced labor involving the region's Muslim Uyghur people.
In December, the US government said it would block all imports of cotton from Xinjiang over concerns they ""may have been made by slave labor in some of the most egregious human rights violations existing today."" 
In the past week, the US, UK and European Union have all put in place new sanctions on Chinese officials  over their role in alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Bejing countered with its own measures, saying its Western critics were ""maliciously spreading lies.""
Meanwhile, as the social media backlash now spreads to other major Western brands, some companies in China have begun to prominently advertise their use of cotton made in Xinjiang. Chinese brand Anta Sports said in a statement it would continue to use cotton from Xinjiang, while Japanese retailer Muji began to advertise products made with ""Xinjiang cotton.""
FILA China, which Anta Sports acquired from Italian brand FILA in 2009, also announced late Thursday it has been using cotton produced in China, including Xinjiang, and had started the procedure to withdraw from BCI.
Some Chinese web users even praised California-based footwear brand Skechers for a recent statement on Uyghur workers, which said its internal audits found no evidence its Chinese supplier had used ""forced labor.""

","H&M, Nike and other big Western apparel brands are facing a boycott in China because of the stand they've taken against the alleged use of forced labor to produce cotton in the country's western region of Xinjiang. H&M and Nike said months ago they were concerned about allegations forced labor has been used to produce cotton in Xinjiang, but they've now been caught in an escalating firestorm that has erupted on Chinese social media this week. Swedish multinational H&M, the world's second-largest clothing retailer, has been pulled from major e-commerce stores in China and blocked by several major navigation, review and rating apps. Videos are circulating on social media that a shopping mall in Chengdu, Sichuan province has removed H&M's advertising sign outside the mall.  Nike and Adidas, among other brands, have also faced heavy criticism. Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily on Thursday named the two firms along with Burberry, New Balance, and other members of the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) that have expressed concerns about cotton produced in Xinjiang. The paper then called for broad boycotts of the brands.  Dozens of Chinese celebrities have terminated contracts or said they would cut ties with these brands, including Nike, Adidas, Puma, Converse, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and Uniqlo ！ a move lauded by state media. And Honor of Kings, Tencent's smash-hit video game, is ending a partnership with Burberry and removing its tartan design from characters' outfits. Nike shares tumbled more than 3% Thursday on Wall Street, while Adidas sank more than 6%. In London, Burberry lost more than 4%. H&M stock also slid nearly 2% in Sweden. The outrage comes after a group linked to the ruling Communist Party posted a statement from H&M about Xinjiang on Chinese social media site Weibo. In the statement, released in September, H&M said it was ""deeply concerned"" over reports of forced labor in the production of cotton in Xinjiang. Human rights groups have repeatedly accused Beijing of detaining Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in the region in ""re-education"" camps and using them as forced labor, which they claim is part of global tech and retail supply chains, either directly or indirectly.  Recent sanctions from the United States and other Western countries over Xinjiang have sparked a renewed pushback from the Chinese government, which calls the camps ""vocational training centers"" designed to combat poverty and religious extremism.  In a viral social media post about H&M, China's Communist Youth League denounced the company's stance. ""Spreading rumors to boycott Xinjiang cotton, while trying to make a profit in China? Wishful thinking!"" the post said. H&M faced a barrage of criticism from Chinese social media users, while Weibo posts containing the hashtag ""I support Xinjiang cotton"" racked up more than 4 billion views. ""H&M clothes are rags,"" one of the most-liked Weibo comments said. ""They don't deserve our Xinjiang cotton!"" Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com even removed all H&M products from sale following the backlash.  People's Daily voiced its outrage at H&M, saying on its official Weibo account: ""China's Xinjiang cotton is white and flawless."" State broadcaster CCTV accused foreign brands of ""earning big profits in China but attacking the country with lies at the same time."" Actor Huang Xuan and actress Song Qian, brand ambassadors for H&M since last year, said separately they would no longer work with the company. In a statement posted Wednesday on Weibo, H&M said it has always maintained high standards and transparency in its global supply chain.  ""[This] does not represent any political position ... H&M Group always respects Chinese consumers. We are committed to long-term investment and development in China,"" the statement said. The company added it was working with ""more than 350 manufacturers"" in China. H&M declined a request from CNN Business for additional comment. Within hours, the criticism had spread to Nike. The company had said nearly a year ago it was ""concerned about reports of forced labor in, and connected to, Xinjiang.""

China sanctions UK lawmakers and entities in retaliation for Xinjiang measures,26/3/2021,"In a statement Friday, China's foreign ministry said the UK had ""imposed unilateral sanctions on relevant Chinese individuals and entity, citing the so-called human rights issues in Xinjiang.""
""This move, based on nothing but lies and disinformation, flagrantly breaches international law and basic norms governing international relations, grossly interferes in China's internal affairs, and severely undermines China-UK relations.""
Those sanctioned include five members of Parliament -- Tom Tugendhat, Iain Duncan Smith, Neil O'Brien, Tim Loughton and Nusrat Ghani -- and two members of the House of Lords, David Alton and Helena Kennedy, as well as academic Joanne Smith Finley and barrister Geoffrey Nice. 
Four entities were also named by Beijing: the China Research Group, Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, Uyghur Tribunal, and Essex Court Chambers, a leading London law firm. 
""China is firmly determined to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests, and warns the UK side not go further down the wrong path,"" the Chinese foreign ministry statement said. ""Otherwise, China will resolutely make further reactions.""
In response, British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab said ""it speaks volumes that, while the UK joins the international community in sanctioning those responsible for human rights abuses, the Chinese government sanctions its critics.""
""If Beijing want to credibly rebut claims of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, it should allow the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights full access to verify the truth,"" he said in a statement.


Those individuals concerned and their immediate family members are prohibited from entering mainland China, Hong Kong and Macao. Their property in China will be frozen, and Chinese citizens and institutions will be prohibited from doing business with them, according to the foreign ministry statement.
The UK's ambassador to China has also been summoned by Beijing, to lodge what it described as ""solemn representations, expressing firm opposition and strong condemnation.""
While relations between Beijing and London have suffered as a result of the ongoing crackdown in Hong Kong, which the UK has suggested breaches a historic agreement with China, the new sanctions could send them to new lows. 
Certainly it is a marked contrast from only five years ago, when then-British Prime Minister David Cameron shared a beer with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to the UK that was supposed to begin a ""new golden era"" in ties between the two nations. 
'Will not be silenced'
Reacting to the news on Twitter, Iain Duncan Smith, an MP and former leader of the Conservative Party, said the sanctions against him were a ""badge of honour."" 
""It's our duty to call out the Chinese (government's) human rights abuse in Hong Kong (and) the genocide of the Uyghurs,"" Duncan Smith wrote. ""Those of us who live free lives under the rule of law must speak for those who have no voice.""
Smith Finley, the British academic, said she had been sanctioned ""for speaking the truth"" about Xinjiang ""and for having a conscience."" 
""I have no regrets for speaking out, and I will not be silenced,"" she tweeted.
The measures come after the UK, in coordination with the European Union, Canada and the United States, announced new sanctions Monday over Xinjiang, targeting those responsible for the crackdown there. 
""These actions demonstrate our ongoing commitment to working multilaterally to advance respect for human rights and shining a light on those in the (Chinese) government and (Communist Party) responsible for these atrocities,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said following the move. 
China responded almost immediately with tit-for-tat penalties, announcing sanctions against 10 EU politicians and four entities -- an aggressive move that has thrown Beijing's relationship with Brussels into doubt. 
Speaking Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said ""for a long period, the US and the West wantonly interfered in other countries' domestic affairs by using democracy and human rights as an excuse.""
In a statement, however, David Sassoli, President of the European Parliament, said China's sanctioning of members of the European Parliament was ""unacceptable and will have consequences.""

Global shipping was in chaos even before the Suez blockage. Shortages and higher prices loom,26/3/2021,"But even before the Ever Given ran aground in the Suez Canal earlier this week, global supply chains were being stretched to the limits, making it much more expensive to move goods around the world and causing shortages of everything from exercise bikes to cheese at a time of unprecedented demand.
A prolonged closure of the key route between West and East could make matters much worse. Costly delays or diversions to longer routes will heap pressure on businesses that are already facing container shortages, port congestion and capacity constraints.
The grounding of the Ever Given is delaying shipments of consumer goods from Asia to Europe and North America, and agricultural products moving in the opposite direction. As of Friday, some 237 vessels, including oil tankers and dozens of container ships, were waiting to transit the canal, which handles about 12% of global trade.
""There's been a great convergence of constraints in supply chains like I've never seen before,"" said Bob Biesterfeld, the CEO of C.H. Robinson, one of the world's largest logistics firms. The bottlenecks are widespread, affecting transport by air, ocean and road, Biesterfeld told CNN Business in an interview. ""It really has been unprecedented.""

Freight costs soaring
More than 80% of global trade by volume is moved by sea, and the disruptions are adding billions of dollars to supply chain costs. Globally, the average cost to ship a 40-foot container shot up from $1,040 last June to $4,570 on March 1, according to S&P Global Platts.
Those costs add up. In February, container shipping costs for seaborne US goods imports totaled $5.2 billion, compared to $2 billion during the same month in 2020, according to S&P Global Panjiva.
These expenses could soon mean higher prices for consumers, adding upward pressure to rising inflation ！ a nightmare scenario for Wall Street, which is already fearful that a spike in prices could force the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates sooner than expected.
""At the moment a lot of these costs are within the supply chains,"" said Chris Rogers, a research analyst at S&P Global Panjiva. ""I think it's inevitable that it will be passed on to consumers ！ it's just going to take time,"" he added. 

The coronavirus wreaked havoc on global supply chains last year, as lockdowns temporarily closed factories and disrupted the normal flow of trade. Economic activity slowed dramatically at the start of the pandemic, and the rapid rebound in trade volumes that followed caught companies off guard.
A pickup in manufacturing and seemingly insatiable demand from housebound consumers for goods such as televisions, furniture and exercise bikes has stretched suppliers and made it difficult for consumers to find the products they'd like to buy.
Manufacturers have also struggled to secure crucial components. Major carmakers, including Ford (F) and Volkswagen (VLKAF), have been forced to idle factories because of a shortage of computer chips caused by high demand for smartphones, gaming systems and other tech gadgets. 
""One year ago, global trade slowed to a crawl as the Covid-19 pandemic first hit China and then spread worldwide,"" Gene Seroka, executive director at the Port of Los Angeles, said in a presentation this month. ""Today, we are in the seventh month of a historic import surge, driven by unprecedented demand by American consumers,"" he added. 
US seaborne imports were nearly 30% higher in February than the same month last year and 20% up on February 2019, according to S&P Global Panjiva.
The import surge in the United States and elsewhere has led to a worldwide container shortage. Everything from cars and machinery to apparel and other consumer staples are shipped in these metal boxes. The factories that make them are mostly in China and many of them closed early in the pandemic, slowing down the rate at which new capacity was coming on stream, according to Rogers.
Containers are in all the wrong places
China's exports recovered fairly quickly compared to the rest of the world. At the same time, major shipping lines had canceled dozens of sailings to respond to the earlier lull in trade. The result was that empty containers piled up in all the wrong places and couldn't meet the sudden demand in Europe and North America for Asia-made goods.
Hapag-Lloyd (HPGLY), one of the world's largest container shipping lines, has deployed about 52 additional vessels just to move hundreds of thousands of empty containers to where they're needed most. In more normal times, there would be fewer than 10. 
""That's in reality about a ship a week that's doing nothing more than moving empty containers,"" CEO Rolf Habben Jansen told investors on a call last week.


The influx of imports has compounded problems at choked up ports, which are contending with labor shortages due to Covid-19 and a slowdown in operations caused by social distancing measures and quarantines. 
On Wednesday, there were two dozen vessels at anchor awaiting entry into either the Port of Los Angeles or the neighboring Port of Long Beach, according to Port of Los Angeles spokesperson, Phillip Sanfield.
""At the Port of Los Angeles, we are actively working on an additional 17 container ships,"" Sanfield told CNN Business. ""Pre-pandemic, we would be working about 10 container ships with no container ships waiting to enter.""
The port processed the equivalent of nearly 800,000 20-foot containers last month ！ the busiest February in its 114-year history. 
Companies feel the strain
Companies from Under Armour (UA) and Hasbro (HAS) to Dollar Tree (DLTR), Urban Outfitters (URBN) and Crocs (CROX) have all warned about the supply chain crunch recently, pointing to container shortages, port congestion, rising shipping costs and logistics challenges.
Costco (COST) said earlier this month that it was having trouble stocking imported cheeses because of a shortage of shipping containers and bottlenecks.
An analysis of 7,000 company earnings calls globally in January and February by S&P Global Panjiva found that more than a quarter mentioned ""freight,"" 37% mentioned ""logistics"" and half discussed supply chains. 
""We know that the freight pressure across retail is here to stay and we've built that into our future plans,"" Mark Tritton, the CEO of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), told investors in January.
Aston Chemicals, a UK company that supplies European manufacturers of personal care products, said its shipping costs were 6.5 times more expensive in January compared to November.  

""We paid almost $14,000 for a container in January,"" said managing director Dani Loughran. That was for a shipment from Malaysia to the port of Felixstowe in England, which just two months earlier had cost $2,100.
Peloton blamed US West Coast port delays for causing ""longer than acceptable wait times"" for the delivery of its high-end exercise bikes. The company told shareholders in February that it's investing over $100 million to expedite deliveries by air and sea over the next six months to improve delivery times.
It's not the only firm resorting to airplanes to move goods that would ordinarily come by boat, as companies scramble to keep up with customer demand.
According to Biesterfeld of C.H. Robinson, a number of durable goods typically transported in shipping containers are being carried in planes, such as toys and games. Companies are ""choosing air freight because inventories are so low,"" he said.
Air freight is more expensive than ocean freight even under normal circumstances and therefore reserved for high-value goods. These costs are even higher at the moment because fewer flights carrying travelers means less available capacity to transport goods, a chunk of which are typically carried in the bellies of passenger planes. 
That will only add to the costs facing businesses and could trickle down to consumers before long.
Higher prices on the way
Companies have so far said very little about how they plan to respond to soaring freight rates but there are early signs that import prices are rising. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, US import prices experienced their largest monthly increase in January since March 2012.
""We anticipate strong demand from consumers to continue over the next couple of months and don't see meaningful change in capacity over that short time period,"" said Biesterfeld.
The cost to move goods by air, ocean, truck and train is now ""structurally up"" on 2019 and contracts reflect that, he added. ""I do think the costs are real and eventually will manifest themselves for consumers,"" he said. 
The extent to which this feeds through to consumer prices will vary from one product to the next. Goods that rely more heavily on imported components will likely cost more. At the same time, if the cost of imported goods rises significantly or these products become less readily available, that could give domestic producers more leeway to increase prices, said Joanna Konings, a senior economist at ING.
Commerzbank analysts said in a note to clients on Friday that the Suez snarl up could cause oil to become more expensive for consumers because of higher tanker rates as a result of the incident.

For Aston Chemicals, the cost increases were so severe that the only option was to pass them on to their customers: businesses that make everyday products such as shampoos, moisturizers and cosmetics. 
If those companies in turn decide to hike prices for their customers, in this case retailers, consumers could start to feel the pinch soon, said Konings.
""Most prices along the supply chain have gone in one direction, and that's up, so it has to appear somewhere.""
","One of the world's most vital trade arteries has been blocked by a quarter-mile-long container ship, creating a traffic jam that has ensnared over 200 vessels and could take weeks to clear.  But even before the Ever Given ran aground in the Suez Canal earlier this week, global supply chains were being stretched to the limits, making it much more expensive to move goods around the world and causing shortages of everything from exercise bikes to cheese at a time of unprecedented demand.

1. Voting rights?
Republicans in Georgia have passed a sweeping elections bill that voting rights advocates say is a bald-faced attempt at voter suppression. The new law imposes new voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, empowers state officials to take over local elections boards, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters in line to give them food and water. The law is seen as a win for former President Trump and his allies, who falsely claimed widespread voter fraud during the 2020 election. Trump himself pressured Georgia leaders to overturn Joe Biden's victory in the state. President Biden has called bills like this ""sick"" and ""un-American."" Other Republican-led states are considering similar voter suppression laws, sparking calls for federal legislation to set a national baseline for voting rules.

2. Coronavirus
The US has now surpassed 30 million total infections in the pandemic. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky again warned that, despite reopenings and a growing desire to get back to normal, the US is still seeing about 1,000 deaths a day and facing the growing threat of coronavirus variants. She also said vaccination efforts are helping the situation. The Biden administration says it will dedicate another $10 billion to expand Covid-19 vaccine access and boost vaccine confidence. The Senate voted to extend the application deadline for the Paycheck Protection Program, the key federal relief effort for small businesses, to May 31. Oh, and good news for new moms: New research shows the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are effective in pregnant and lactating women, who can pass protective antibodies to newborns.

3. White House?
Biden held his first official White House news conference yesterday. During the highly-anticipated talk, he took a strong stance on his goal of reforming the Senate filibuster. The filibuster generally refers to any time senators demand a supermajority to cut off debate and move to an actual vote. Ending it would mean legislation would pass by simple majority -- a critical thing to consider in a closely divided Senate. When discussing immigration, Biden downplayed the growing crisis at the southern border and said the policies of his predecessor have made it harder to house and properly process the record number of migrant children in custody. On the international front, Biden said one of his main priorities is repairing global relationships. He also identified the top foreign policy issue he's facing right now: North Korea.

4. Foreign policy
The Biden administration faces other foreign policy challenges too. During his news conference, Biden expressed uncertainty at meeting the May 1 deadline for a full troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. A six-month extension is being considered, and Biden said he ""can't picture"" US troops still being in Afghanistan next year. Meanwhile, the US will resume diplomatic ties with Palestinians that were cut under the prior administration. Trump cut hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Palestinians, bringing diplomatic contact to a virtual halt. US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the Biden team will work toward a negotiated two-state solution that ensures Israel's future as a democratic and Jewish state while upholding Palestinians' legitimate aspirations for a state of their own.

5. China
China has launched more retaliatory measures in response to international sanctions over Xinjiang. The Chinese government announced sanctions against UK lawmakers, academics and entities, barring them from entering China and freezing their assets there. The UK's ambassador to China has also been summoned by Beijing. H&M, Nike and other big Western apparel brands have expressed concern in recent months over the alleged use of forced labor to produce cotton in Xinjiang, one of the types of human rights violations China is accused of in the region. Now, those retailers are facing heavy criticism, including threats of boycott and terminated contracts with some Chinese celebrities.

Chinese Ambassador to the US: China's goal is not to replace United States,26/3/2021,"""Our goal is to meet the growing inspiration of the Chinese people for better life. Our goal is not to compete with, or replace any other country,"" Cui Tiankai told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview.
""This has never been our national strategy,"" Cui added.
The Chinese Ambassador was responding to comments made earlier on Thursday by US President Joe Biden, who said that China had ""an overall goal of becoming the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world and the most powerful country in the world.""
""It's not going to happen on my watch,"" added Biden, who spoke at length about his administration's goals with China during his first presidential news conference on Thursday.
Biden's remarks followed an acrimonious first face-to-face meeting between US and Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska last week, where US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's statement that the Biden administration would bring up ""deep concerns"" about some of China's actions around the world was met with immediate pushback from Chinese counterparts.

Thursday's tone was far more conciliatory. The Ambassador called the Alaska talks ""a timely one,"" and ""helpful,"" adding it ""it certainly helped both sides to have a better understanding of the other.""
Cui told CNN: ""What today's world wants, and what tomorrow's world would want, is to join efforts by all countries to build a community of nations for a shared future.""
""We don't think any attempt to divide the world into different camps or even build confrontational military approach, we don't think this kind of approach is a solution. Actually, this is a problem in itself,"" he said.
Pressed to respond on accusations made by Biden that China is not playing by international rules on fair competition, Cui said: ""We'll have no problem with open and fair competition -- actually we very much stand for that.""
However, he added that ""past mistakes"" would have to be ""corrected"" as a precondition to fair competition: ""How can we have fair competition when Chinese companies are discriminated against? When Chinese senior CEOs are detained without any reason? When there's such clear attempt to politicize everything. When there's such an attempt of nationalism and protectionism against international rules? So in order to have open, fair competition, past mistakes will have to be corrected first.""
Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou is currently fighting extradition to the United States, where she is wanted for allegedly breaching sanctions against Iran.
Calling out human rights abuses
In the wide-ranging interview, Ciu also responded to CNN's reporting on Uyghur children who have been separated from their families and kept from leaving China's Xinjiang region. 
The Ambassador inaccurately described the report as false, as well as ""immoral,"" claims which Amanpour rebutted, explaining, ""This was not manipulated. This was parents desperate, can't find their children, want to try to be reunited with their children, and the reporter did his journalistic duty. It's called investigative reporting.""
In a recent report, Amnesty International estimated China's polices towards ethnic Uyghurs has split up thousands of families, as some children are prevented from leaving China's Xinjiang region to be with their parents living abroad. CNN traveled to the heavily surveilled region and found some of the children left behind.
Pressed by Amanpour to respond to a Newslines Institute for Strategy and Policy report that China is allegedly conducting policies of mass internment, mass birth-prevention, forcible transfer of Uyghur children to state-run facilities, the eradication of Uyghur identity and culture as well as selective targeting of intellectual and community leaders, Ciu responded, ""China is not doing these things."" 
""It is very unfortunate that some people, including some journalists, they start with very strong bias and prejudice, that's their problem. That's how they come to very different conclusions about particular situations, very much against real facts,"" he added.
CNN has previously reported numerous allegations of abuse of detained Uyghurs in China. As many as two million people may have been taken to internment camps in the Xinjiang region, according to the US State Department. 
Chinese authorities have cast the camps as ""education centers"" to curb extremism. Cui on Thursday echoed that point, telling Amanpour that ""the government had to do something"" to prevent possible terror attacks in the region.
""What we did was not to start a war there. We did not use missiles or drones. We set up efforts for education and training, help people learn more about the law, to acquire good skills to improve their lives and find good jobs. And all these have made a huge difference. There's been no single terrorist attack in the last few years,"" he said.
On Thursday, Biden said he'd made it clear to Chinese president Xi Jinping that the US will continue to call out China's human rights abuses. ""America values human rights. We don't always live up to our expectations but it's a value system. We are founded on that principle,"" Biden said. 
""And as long as you and your country continues to so blatantly violate human rights, we are going to continue in an unrelenting way to call to the attention of the world and make it clear and make it clear what's happening,"" Biden added. 
On Monday, the US announced sanctions  against two Chinese government officials for ""human rights abuses"" against minorities in Xinjiang including of Uyghur Muslims. The European Union also announced its sanctions Monday, naming Zhu Hailun, former head of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), and three other top officials.
Ciu told Amanpour that he had been to Xinjiang ""more than once in recent years,"" saying, ""what I saw is a very different story, a very different picture from the reporting.""
He added that the first principle set out in the United Nations Charter of sovereign equality of all members, and the obligation of all UN members to refrain from threat or use of force against territorial integrity and political independence of any state, were ""rules that every country should follow."" 
""So if people are interested in these rules, maybe they should start by reading the Charter first. If people really want to show us the power of example, I would suggest they could very well start with their own compliance with all these truly universally-agreed principles,"" he said.
","China's goal is not to replace the United States as the world's leading country, the Chinese Ambassador to the US said Thursday.

Biden says US faces battle to 'prove democracy works',26/3/2021,"The President underscored that the United States faces an unprecedented array of tests, with Beijing posing what might be the trickiest strategic challenge of all. 
As global freedoms ebb, groundbreaking technological shifts are disrupting economies and climate change is posing an existential threat, all while Moscow continues challenging the West and an increasingly aggressive Beijing seeks to become -- in Biden's words Thursday -- ""the most powerful country in the world."" 
Biden had been asked at his first press conference as President Thursday whether he would maintain tariffs on Beijing or ban Chinese goods made with forced labor. The questions were legitimate, the President said, ""but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really is about."" Biden then drew back and offered his analysis of the hydra-headed challenge facing the country and the world.  
""I predict to you your children or grandchildren are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded, autocracy or democracy, because that is what is at stake,"" he said. ""Not just with China. Look around the world. We're in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence. Will there be a middle class? How will people adjust to these significant changes in science and technology? The environment. How will they do that?"" 
""It is clear, absolutely clear ... this is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies,"" Biden said. ""That's what's at stake here. We've got to prove democracy works."" 
'Steep, steep competition'
The multi-part challenge Biden described has shaped his administration's foreign policy vision, one that Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed this week on an alliance-building trip to NATO headquarters in Brussels, where he also framed the contest as a standoff between autocracies and democracies and referred often to the challenge posed by China. 
One Biden foreign policy goal is to show Americans the importance of global engagement by underscoring the link between their prosperity, safety and well-being at home, and US leadership and policies abroad. A second goal, which Blinken highlighted last week in Japan and South Korea and this week in Europe, is to restore US alliances and re-establish US global leadership. 
Biden, who developed a relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping while both were serving as vice presidents, said Thursday that Xi ""doesn't have a democratic with a small 'D' bone in his body, but he's a smart, smart guy. He's one of the guys, like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future.""
The clash between Biden's administration and China got off to a heated start with an unusually undiplomatic confrontation with Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan during a meeting last week in Alaska, when the officials from Beijing bristled at US criticism of China's human rights record, economic coercion and aggressive expansion in Asian waters. 
On Thursday, Biden outlined his own, more quiet stand off with Xi, a two-hour marathon phone call in which ""we made several things clear to one another."" 
Biden told the Chinese leader ""that we're not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition"" and that ""we'll insist that China play by the international rules, fair competition, fair practices, fair trade."" 
Biden told reporters his administration would also make three changes to compete more effectively with China and for the future. First, he said it will invest ""in American workers and American science."" 
""The future lies in who can, in fact, own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including the medical fields,"" Biden said, announcing greater investment in medical research and the ""industries of the future, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech."" 
""We're going to make real investments,"" Biden said. ""China is out-investing us by a long shot because their plan is to own that future.""
The US will re-establish its alliances as a second step, with Biden set to host ""an alliance of democracies"" meeting in Washington, where countries will ""discuss the future"" and ""hold China accountable to follow the rules.""
Biden's third step, he said, will be to ensure the US stands up for its values and calls out China's abuses of human rights. ""America values human rights,"" he said. ""We don't always live up to our expectations but it's a value system. We are founded on that principle. And as long as you and your country continue to so blatantly violate human rights, we're going to continue in an unrelenting way to call it to the attention of the world and make it clear, make it clear what's happening.""
Referring to former President Donald Trump, Biden said the US pays a cost when it fails to stand up for its values. ""The moment a president walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world,"" Biden said. Trump told Xi he had no objection to detention camps for Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang province, and according to his former national security advisor John Bolton, encouraged them. Trump denounced Bolton as a ""liar."" 
In Belgium, Blinken delivered a speech Wednesday on alliances, emphasizing values, the strength that comes from unity, and the need for greater collaboration in areas like cybersecurity, energy security, health security, and critical infrastructure safeguards.
In remarks Tuesday, the top US diplomat explained why the US and its democratic allies have to focus on delivering to their citizens at home as a way of countering the challenge posed by top-down autocratic countries such as China and Russia. 
""There's no doubt that we've been experiencing in recent years what some have called a democratic recession,"" Blinken said in Brussels. ""We see countries falling back on some of the basic hallmarks of democracy."" Blinken pointed to a study by Freedom House, an organization that tracks freedom and democracy and has found that of the 40 or so countries that have been consistently ranked as fully free through the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, ""fully half have fallen back."" 
Fundamental freedoms
""At the very same time that that's happening, we're seeing the rise in strength of autocracies that are posing a direct challenge to democracies and saying, 'We can deliver better for our people',"" Blinken said.   
""We must demonstrate not only what our alliances defend against, but also what they stand for, like the right of all people everywhere to be treated with dignity and have their fundamental freedoms respected,"" Blinken said. ""This is where our interest in being trustworthy allies is bound up in fulfilling the needs of our citizens. We can't build a foreign policy that delivers for the American people without maintaining effective alliances. And we can't sustain effective alliances without showing how they deliver for the American people."" 
Acknowledging the severe strain that US democracy and values have come under in recent years, Blinken added that the main challenge the US and allies have is to demonstrate ""that in fact, democracies are more adept at delivering what people need and what they want.""
Biden said Thursday that he doesn't criticize China for its ambitions. 
""China has an overall goal, and I don't criticize them for the goal,"" he said, ""but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world and the most powerful country in the world."" 
""That's not going to happen on my watch,"" the President said, ""because the United States is going to continue to grow and expand."" 
","President Joe Biden cast challenges to the US from China, Russia and global shifts in stark terms Thursday, describing ""a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies.""

In Belgium, Blinken delivered a speech Wednesday on alliances, emphasizing values, the strength that comes from unity, and the need for greater collaboration in areas like cybersecurity, energy security, health security, and critical infrastructure safeguards. In remarks Tuesday, the top US diplomat explained why the US and its democratic allies have to focus on delivering to their citizens at home as a way of countering the challenge posed by top-down autocratic countries such as China and Russia.  ""There's no doubt that we've been experiencing in recent years what some have called a democratic recession,"" Blinken said in Brussels. ""We see countries falling back on some of the basic hallmarks of democracy."" Blinken pointed to a study by Freedom House, an organization that tracks freedom and democracy and has found that of the 40 or so countries that have been consistently ranked as fully free through the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, ""fully half have fallen back.""  Fundamental freedoms ""At the very same time that that's happening, we're seeing the rise in strength of autocracies that are posing a direct challenge to democracies and saying, 'We can deliver better for our people',"" Blinken said.    ""We must demonstrate not only what our alliances defend against, but also what they stand for, like the right of all people everywhere to be treated with dignity and have their fundamental freedoms respected,"" Blinken said. ""This is where our interest in being trustworthy allies is bound up in fulfilling the needs of our citizens. We can't build a foreign policy that delivers for the American people without maintaining effective alliances. And we can't sustain effective alliances without showing how they deliver for the American people.""  Acknowledging the severe strain that US democracy and values have come under in recent years, Blinken added that the main challenge the US and allies have is to demonstrate ""that in fact, democracies are more adept at delivering what people need and what they want."" Biden said Thursday that he doesn't criticize China for its ambitions.  ""China has an overall goal, and I don't criticize them for the goal,"" he said, ""but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world and the most powerful country in the world.""  ""That's not going to happen on my watch,"" the President said, ""because the United States is going to continue to grow and expand."" ",politics,POLITICS
Biden holds first presidential news conference,26/3/2021,,"In his first formal news conference since taking office, President Biden spent over an hour today fielding questions from the press on topics ranging from immigration to the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccines.  Two of the topics the press and Biden did not address at length were the coronavirus variants and gun control, which has taken on added significance over the past two weeks following mass shootings in Atlanta and Boulder, Colorado. Here are some of the most important lines on topics Biden did discuss: On immigration: Biden claimed?the current surge in migrants at the US southern border is not unprecedented. ""Truth of the matter is nothing has changed. ... As many people came, 28%?increase in the children in the?border in my administration, 31%?in the last year in 2019 before?the pandemic in the Trump?administration.?It happens every single solitary?year,"" he said. Biden said he wants to rebuild the immigration system, adding that the US is sending back the ""vast majority"" of families showing up at the border.
On unaccompanied children at the border: ""The idea that I'm?going to say, which I would?never do, if an unaccompanied?child ends up at the border?we're going to let them starve?to death and stay on the other?side, no previous administration?did that either, except Trump.?I'm not going to do it.?I'm not going to do it,"" Biden said.
On the conditions at a border protection facility in Texas: ""[W]e're going to be?moving a thousand of those kids?out quickly.?That's why I got Fort Bliss?opened up.?That's why I've been working?from the moment this started?happening to try to find?additional access for children?to be able to safely, not just?children, but particularly?children to be able to safely be?housed while we follow through?on the rest of what's happening,"" Biden said. The President called conditions at packed migrant facilities such as the one in Donna, Texas, that houses migrant children ""totally unacceptable.""
On administering the Covid-19 vaccines: Biden formally said his administration has set a new goal to get 200 million coronavirus vaccine doses into arms by his 100th day in office. ""I know it's ambitious. Twice our original goal. But no other country in the world has even come close, not even close to what we are doing. I believe we can do it,"" Biden said.
On reopening schools around the country: Biden cited a report out this week from the Department of Education that shows nearly half of K-8 schools are open C a step toward his goal of getting a majority of K-8 schools fully open in the first 100 days. ＾[W]e¨re really close, and I believe in the 35 days left to go we¨ll meet that goal as well,￣ Biden said.
On stimulus payments: ""As of yesterday more than 100 million payments of $1,400 have gone into people's bank accounts. That's real money in people's pockets bringing relief instantly, almost. And millions more will be getting their money very soon,"" Biden said. Approximately 127 million stimulus payments worth around $325 billion have been sent to Americans under the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration announced Wednesday.
On infrastructure: Biden said he expects to announce his next major initiative in Pittsburgh that will aim to rebuild both?the ""physical and technological?infrastructure in this country so we can compete and create significant numbers of?really good-paying jobs."" The White House confirmed that Biden is traveling to Pittsburgh on?Wednesday, March 31.
On voting rights: Biden called Republican efforts to restrict voting in many states, ""un-American"" and ""sick"" and compared the efforts to Jim Crow laws that enforced racial segregation in the South. ""What I'm worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is,"" said Biden of Republican efforts on a statewide level to implement rules that would make voting more cumbersome?for many voters and especially minority voters. 
On filibuster reform: Biden expressed support for filibuster reform, suggesting he was willing to bend or even abolish the arcane Senate rule on certain issues, in order to accomplish his agenda. The President first said he believed senators ought to have to hold the floor in order to delay action in the Senate. The filibuster is being ""abused in a gigantic way,"" Biden added.
On running for reelection in 2024: ""Yes, my plan is to run for reelection. That's my expectation,"" Biden said. President Biden?spent much of his?first presidential news conference?today facing questions about the?crisis on the southern border,?promising conditions for unaccompanied minors arriving in the US will improve and blaming the prior administration and the cooler weather for the?spike of migrants at the border. The President faced a wide-ranging set of questions?from reporters about other pressing issues, including the Senate's filibuster rules, working with Republicans on Capitol Hill and voting rights issues in states. Foreign policy was also a central topic as the President faces a slew of diplomatic hurdles with?North Korea,?China?and?Afghanistan. But it was the crisis at the southern border that dominated the news conference. His administration has faced scrutiny over the growing number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border and the limited press access to border facilities. Here's a look at how much time Biden and White House reporters spent talking about different issues today:  CNN's Daniel Dale fact checked President Biden's claim that a ""vast majority"" of migrants at the US Southern border are being ""sent back"" home.  Dale noted that according to official statistics from February, while a vast majority of single adults were being sent back home, 79%, only 41% of migrants coming as part of family units were being sent back under the pandemic-related rule, Title 42.  Dale also caution that ""we don't?have full data for March.?It's possible things have?changed."" ""Biden made a?more accurate claim about the?overall group of migrants but?for families in particular, for this?particular claim, his claim is?not true,"" Dale told CNN's Jake Tapper.  Watch more: ##Immigration## ##Fact Check## While discussing?his?goal to reach 200 million Covid-19 vaccinations in the first 100 days of his administration, President Biden?repeated his?claim?that ＾no other country in the world has even come close, not even close to what we are doing￣ on the vaccine front.?? Facts First:?It's true that no country has vaccinated more total people than the US, though it's worth noting that there are some smaller countries that have vaccinated a larger share of their total population. So far, the US has administered vaccines to more than?130?million people, a higher number than any other country in the world. However,?16?countries?and territories?including Chile, Israel and the United Kingdom have?administered vaccines to?more people per capita. It should be noted that these countries?and territories?have much smaller populations.? ##Fact Check## ##Vaccines## As he wrapped up his first news conference since becoming President, Biden made clear that he is willing to work with any Republican who?wants to make the situation better. His comments came in response to a question from Univision's Janet Rodr┴guez?about the situation at the border. ""If I may ask one last?question, have you had any talks?with Senate Republicans who are?threatening this administration?with not considering the?immigration legislation that was?passed in the House until the?situation at the border has been?resolved?""?Rodriguez asked. ""No,"" Biden responded. ""Because I know they have to?posture for a while.?Just for the guys to get it out?of their system."" ""But I am ready to?work with any Republican who?wants to help solve the problem?or make the situation better,"" the President added. Watch Biden's response: ##Immigration## President Biden today said the situation at the US-Mexico border was already improving under his leadership and pledged the situation would get a ""a hell of a lot better"" soon. ""They are already getting better but they are going to get a whole hell of a lot better real quicker, you are going hear some people leaving,"" he said.?""We can get this done."" As a spike of migrants continue to show up at the border, Biden said he was under no illusion he would be able to solve all of the problems at the border, but suggested he would be able to dramatically improve conditions for many migrants.  ""I can't?guarantee we are going to solve?everything,"" he said.?""But I can guarantee we can make?everything better.?We can make it better.?We can change the lives of so?many people.?"" ##Immigration## White House advisers are expected to present a two-part, $3 trillion jobs and infrastructure proposal to President Biden as soon as this week, CNN reported on Monday.  Biden said in his news conference today that he expects to announce his next major initiative during his upcoming trip to Pittsburgh that will aim to rebuild both?""the physical and technological?infrastructure in this country so we can compete and create significant numbers of?really good-paying jobs."" The proposal, which Biden's top advisers have been deliberating over for weeks, would be segmented into two separate parts:  One focused on infrastructure and clean energy
A second focused on what's being termed the ""care economy"" with a focus zeroed in on key domestic economic issues In full, it would mark a sweeping move toward enacting the key elements of the ""jobs"" agenda that Biden laid out in large part during his campaign for president, with a suite of potential tax increases on corporations and the wealthy as options to finance any longer-term spending in the final proposal. The package will explode spending and is also expected to raise taxes on individuals earning more than $400,000 a year, as well as increase the corporate tax rate. White House officials stressed that no final decisions about the final path forward have been made at this point.  Biden still has to review the proposals and plans to consult heavily with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about the scale and legislative sequencing of the next key pillar of his agenda. President Biden spoke at length today about what the US must do in order to hold China accountable regarding imports, exports, and human rights issues. ""Earlier this month, and?apparently got the Chinese?attention, that's not why I did?it, I met with our allies and?how we're going to hold China?accountable in the region; Australia, India, Japan, and the?United States, the so-called?quad.?Because we have to have?democracies working together.?Before too long, I'm going to?have ！ I'm going to invite an?alliance of democracies to come?here to discuss the future, and?so we're going to make it clear?that in order to deal with these?things, we are going to hold?China accountable to follow the?rules; to follow the rules,"" Biden said. There is currently a tariff on the majority of the goods being shipped from China into the United States. The average rate is 19% ！ more than six times higher than before the trade war began in 2018, according to the?Peterson Institute for International Economics. American importers pay those duties. The taxes have raised the price for items such as?baseball hats, luggage,?bicycles, TVs,?sneakers?and a variety of materials used by American manufacturers. The tariffs on Chinese-made goods have cost American importers more than $82 billion so far, according to?US Customs and Border Protection. Biden also addressed lingering human rights issues plaguing China. ""Americans value the?notion of freedom.?America values human rights.?We don't always live up to our?expectations but it's a value?system. ... And as long as you and your?country continue to so blatantly?violate human rights, we're?going to continue in an?unrelenting way to call to the?attention of the world and make?it clear, make it clear what's?happening,"" he said today. More background: The US announced sanctions Monday against two Chinese officials for ""serious human rights abuses"" against?Uyghur Muslims, a step coordinated with allies including the European Union, Canada and the United Kingdom, which imposed sanctions on the same individuals and others, the Treasury Department said. The announcement was part of a broader show of unity by the US and its international allies, all voicing condemnation for Beijing's repression of Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang province. Watch Biden's response: President Biden said he expects to run for reelection in 2024.  ""Yes, my?plan is to run for reelection.?That's my expectation,"" Biden said to CBS' Nancy Cordes during his first news conference since his term began.  Former President Trump had announced his plans for reelection soon after starting his first term.  Biden later noted to CNN's Kaitlan Collins: ""I'm a great respecter of fate.?I've never been able to plan?four-and-a-half, three-and-a-half years ahead for certain."" Asked who would be his running mate, Biden said he expects it would be Vice President Kamala Harris, ""She's doing a great job. She's a great partner."" Watch the exchange: President Biden warned that there would be ""responses"" if North Korea continues to fire ballistic missiles, following their second launch in less than a week.? Asked about the launches at his news conference, Biden told reporters, ＾We¨re consulting with our allies and partners and there will be responses if they choose to escalate. We will respond accordingly.￣ The President also said that he agreed with then-President Barack Obama who warned in 2016 while leaving office that North Korea is the biggest foreign policy threat and issue, answering simply: ""Yes."" Biden added that he¨s also ＾prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization.￣ ＾So that¨s what we¨re doing right now, consulting with our allies.￣? On Thursday, North Korea launched?two ballistic missiles ！ the second such launch in less than a week. South Korea's joint chiefs of staff said in a statement that two short-range missiles had been fired from the Hamju area of South Hamgyong province toward the sea, off North Korea's east coast, at 7:06 a.m. and 7:25 a.m. local time.? The projectiles flew about 450 kilometers (280 miles), reaching an altitude of 60 kilometers (37 miles), and are believed to have been ballistic missiles launched from the ground, the statement said. The exact type of the missiles was unclear, a senior US official told CNN earlier, citing an intelligence briefing. ? President Biden today called Republican efforts to restrict voting in many states, ""un-American"" and ""sick"" and compared the efforts to Jim Crow laws that enforced racial segregation in the South. ""What I'm worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is,"" said Biden of Republican efforts on a statewide level to implement rules that would make voting more cumbersome?for many voters and especially minority voters.  ""It's sick. It's sick,"" he added,? ""This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle,"" he continued. ""...This is gigantic, what they are trying to do and it cannot be sustained. I am going to do everything in my power ... to keep that from becoming the law."" Biden did express hope that he would be able to slow or stop the effort, saying he believed there was bipartisan support to keep voting as open as possible.? ""The Republican voters I know, find this despicable,"" he said. ""...I am talking about voters. Voters. And so I'm convinced that we will be able to stop this, because it is the most pernicious thing."" CNN's Kaitlan Collins pressed Biden about his stance on the filibuster. Watch the exchange: Republicans at the state level have moved swiftly to either?roll back some easy access to voting?or put new obstacles in the way of voters following losses in the?2020 presidential?and?US Senate elections. More than 250 bills to curb or complicate access to polls had been introduced in 43 state legislatures as of February 19, according to?the Brennan Center for Justice, which is tracking the bills ！ and bills have since been introduced in at least two more states, North Carolina and Wisconsin, according to CNN reporting. Key states to watch: Florida, Arizona and Georgia were all battleground states in 2020 and host US Senate races in 2022. Republican legislative majorities and GOP governors are moving to make it more difficult to vote in these states. The Republican-led Georgia House of Representatives on Thursday passed its version of a?sweeping election overhaul bill, moving it one step closer to enacting election law changes and restricting voter access in the state. Texas does not have a 2022 Senate race, but it will feature a race for governor in 2022. Republicans currently control all levers of the state government there. There are proposals to make it more difficult to vote in other key states ！ Wisconsin and Pennsylvania ！ featuring 2022 Senate races, but divided government in those places will make restrictions more difficult to enact. There is no Senate race in Michigan and there is also divided government there. (See a breakdown of state government control here.) What's happening in Congress: House Democrats have passed?a sweeping bill that includes a number of voting reforms, including automatic national voter registration. Currently, 18 states and Washington, DC, have automatic registration. Expanding that requirement nationwide could enfranchise 50 million Americans,?according to the Brennan Center. The bill would do a lot more, including putting an end to partisan gerrymandering, by which parties draw congressional lines to protect their incumbents, mandating a two-week early voting period and more. But it would require a supermajority ！ 60 votes ！ to overcome a promised GOP filibuster in the Senate. Democrats have suggested changing Senate rules specifically for this bill, but it's not clear all Democrats would support the rule change. CNN's Kelly Mena, Dianne Gallagher and Pamela Kirkland contributed reporting to this post.? President Biden was pressed by ABC's Cecilia Vega about his reaction to the conditions at a border protection facility in Donna, Texas.  ""There are kids that are sleeping?on floors.?They are packed into these pods.?I've spoken to lawyers who say?that some of these children have?not seen the sun in days.?What's your reaction C what is?your reaction to these images?that have come out from that?particular facility?"" Alvear asked Biden said that he thought the conditions were ""totally unacceptable"" and said his administration is looking to find other locations for the children. ""That's a serious question,?right??Is it acceptable to me??Come on.?That's why we're going to be?moving a thousand of those kids?out quickly.?That's why I got Fort Bliss?opened up.?That's why I've been working?from the moment this started?happening to try to find?additional access for children?to be able to safely, not just?children, but particularly?children to be able to safely be?housed while we follow through?on the rest of what's happening. That is totally unacceptable,"" Biden said.  Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar provided CNN with photos revealing the conditions for dozens of children and adults in an overflow facility in Donna, Texas.  ##Immigration## President Biden pledged to allow journalists into overcrowded migrant facilities at the US-Mexico border.  ""I will commit when my plan,?very shortly, is underway to let?you have access to not just them?but to other facilities as?well,"" said in response to NBC News' Kristen Welker.  ""I will commit to?transparency, and as soon as I'm?in a position to be able to?implement what we're doing right?now.?One of the reasons I haven't?gone down ！ my chief folks have?gone down ！ is I don't want to?become the issue,"" he added.  Biden did not give a timeframe on when that would happen.  Biden also said he makes ""no apology"" for rolling back some of Trump's immigration policies.  ""All the?policies underway were not?helping at all, did not slow up?the amount of immigration, and?as many people coming.?And rolling back the policies of?separating children from their?mothers, I make no apology for?that,"" he said.  ##Immigration## President Biden said he would never let an unaccompanied child who arrives to the US border starve to death under his leadership. ""The idea that I'm?going to say, which I would?never do, if an unaccompanied?child ends up at the border?we're going to let them starve?to death and stay on the other?side, no previous administration?did that either, except Trump.?I'm not going to do it.?I'm not going to do it,"" Biden told ABC's Cecilia Vega. His remarks came after Vega described the plight of Central American migrants to the US, particularly the story of a 9-year-old boy who walked by himself to the border with another boy from Honduras. ""His mother said she sent her son?to this country because she?believes that you are not?deporting unaccompanied minors?like her son.?That's why she sent him alone?from Honduras,"" she said. When asked if these?unaccompanied minors would be allowed to stay in?the US, or would they be?deported eventually, Biden said, ""Well, the judgment has to be?made whether or not ！ and this?young man's case, he has a mom?at home.?There's an overwhelming reason?why he'd be put on a plane and?flown back to his mom."" Some context: More than 400,000 migrant children?have crossed the US border without their parents since 2003. And each time a new wave arrives, political controversy follows. The numbers are on the rise?again,?with some children arriving who are as young as 6 or 7. This increase is sparking?fierce debate?in Washington,?concern from children's advocates?and?an emergency response from the Biden administration. ##Immigration## President Biden addressed the spike of migrants at the US-Mexico border and noted how an ""overwhelming"" majority of those who are crossing the border are being ""sent back"" home.  ""Tens of thousands of?people who are over 18 years of?age and single people, one at a?time coming, have been sent back,?sent home.?We're sending back the vast?majority of the families that?are coming. We're trying to work?out now, with Mexico, their?willingness to take more of?those families back.?But that's what's happening.?They're not coming across the border. And those coming across the?border who are unaccompanied?children, we're moving rapidly to?try to put in place what was?dismantled, as I said,"" he said. Biden added that his administration is ""building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that Trump dismantled. It's going to take time.""  When PBS' Yamiche Alcindor pressed Biden on why some families are not being sent back  home, he said it is ""because Mexico is refusing to?take them back.?They're saying they won't take?them back, not all of them.?We're in negotiations with the?president of Mexico."" ""I think we're going to see that?change.?They should all be going back.?All be going back. The only people we're not going?to let sitting there on the?other side of the Rio Grande by?themselves, with no help, are?children,"" Biden explained.  WATCH: ##Immigration## President Biden expressed support for filibuster reform, suggesting he was willing to bend or even abolish the arcane Senate rule on certain issues, in order to accomplish his agenda. Responding to a reporter's question, Biden first said he believed senators ought to have to hold the floor in order to delay action in the Senate.  ""It used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing,"" he said. ""...I strongly support moving in that direction."" The filibuster is being ""abused in a gigantic way,"" he added. But Biden also suggested that he was willing to consider doing away with the rule, at least on some issues, if Republicans' recalcitrance continued.? ""We're going to get a lot done,"" he said. ""If we have to, if there's complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we'll have to go beyond what I'm talking about."" Why is he talking about the filibuster? Some Democrats in Congress want to change Senate rules so they can use their slim majority to pass things unlikely to garner Republican support, such as a voting rights bill or the massive infrastructure package that Biden is expected to introduce.  Right now they need to garner 60 votes to overcome Republican objection ！ or, filibuster ！ a tally that requires several Republicans to join Democrats. You can read more on the filibuster here. The situation at the US-Mexico border has been a central topic in today's news conference. The Biden administration is scrambling to find adequate housing for the rising number of unaccompanied minors arriving at the US-Mexico border.  Republicans have slammed Biden's handling of the situation, blaming his early actions to overturn some of the Trump administration's border enforcement policies for inducing what is shaping up to be a historic surge of migrants to the border. During his first week in office, Biden signed a slew of executive actions aimed at undoing Trump's immigration policies and released?comprehensive immigration reform legislation. Most notable among the changes has been the decision to no longer expel unaccompanied minors who show up at the border, resulting in more children coming into US custody. Biden has said that he will travel to the border at some point, and senior administration officials and lawmakers have already made the trip down to see facilities housing the migrants. A group of White House officials and members of Congress toured a Texas facility on Wednesday holding unaccompanied migrant children and for the first time under the Biden administration a news camera was allowed inside. These are some of the latest figures:  There are more than 16,000 unaccompanied children in US custody, including around 4,800 in US Customs and Border Protection custody
At least 11,300 unaccompanied children are in Department of Health and Human Services custody.
As of Sunday, more than 800 unaccompanied migrant children had been in Border Patrol custody for more than 10 days, according to documents reviewed by CNN.  Federal law requires unaccompanied children to be turned over within 72 hours to HHS, which oversees a shelter network designed to house minors, but amid constraints related to the pandemic, children are staying in custody for longer than the 72-hour limit. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, Jeremy Herb and Jeremy Diamond contributed reporting to this post ##Immigration## President Biden said it would be difficult to meet the May 1 deadline that the Trump administration had negotiated with the Taliban to?withdraw all US forces from Afghanistan. ""It's going?to be hard to meet the May 1?deadline.?Just in terms of tactical?reasons, hard to get those?troops out,"" Biden said at a news conference today. Biden said the US is in consultation with our allies on how to proceed. Last week, a defense official told CNN that the Biden administration was considering a six-month extension for American troops in Afghanistan. At that time, no final decision had been made, the official emphasized.? Remember: Biden has some domestic political cover ！ some members in Congress are worried about a full drawdown. And the President has been sharply critical of the details that Trump administration negotiated. President Biden claimed?the current surge in migrants at the US southern border is not unprecedented.  ""Truth of the matter is nothing has changed. ... As many people came, 28%?increase in the children in the?border in my administration, 31%?in the last year in 2019 before?the pandemic in the Trump?administration.?It happens every single solitary?year,"" Biden said in response to a question asked by PBS¨ Yamiche Alcindor. He pushed back against claims that migrants are trying to get into the US because he's a ""decent man, or however it's phrased"" and that his administration is more lax than the Trump administration in terms of immigration. ""By the way,?does anybody suggest that there?was a 31% increase under Trump?because he was a nice guy??And he was doing good things at?the border??That's not the reason they're?coming.?The reason they're coming is?that it's the time they can?travel with the least likelihood?of dying on the way because of?the heat in the desert, number?one.?Number two, they're coming?because of the circumstances in?[their] country,"" Biden said.  ""I'd like to think it's?because I'm a nice guy, but it's?not; it's because of what's?happened every year,"" he added. Biden said he wants to rebuild the immigration system, adding that the US is sending back the ""vast majority"" of families showing up at the border.  ""Those coming across the?border who are unaccompanied?children, we're moving rapidly to?try to put in place what was?dismantled,"" he said.  Read more: US border officials are detaining on average more than 600 unaccompanied migrant children who cross the border each day, a Department of Homeland Security official familiar with the data told CNN.  The daily average as of Tuesday far surpasses the height of the 2019 surge of migrant families, when Border Patrol apprehended around 370 unaccompanied children a day on average, according to agency data. ##Immigration## President Biden was just asked about his stance on the filibuster.  Some Democrats in Congress want to change Senate rules so they can use their slim majority to pass things unlikely to garner Republican support, such as a voting rights bill or the massive infrastructure package that Biden is expected to introduce.  Right now they need to garner 60 votes to overcome Republican objection ！ or, filibuster ！ a tally that requires several Republicans to join Democrats. Biden's legislative agenda will be greatly affected by whether the filibuster stays or goes.  The President has said he supports changing?the Senate's filibuster rule?by bringing back the talking filibuster, requiring a senator who wants to block legislation to hold the floor without taking a break. The Covid-19 relief package was able to pass through Congress because of a special budget process called reconciliation, which Democrats used to advance the legislation in the chamber with only a simple majority and no Republican support.  But those rules can't apply to things such as gun control or voting rights because they aren't budget related. In addition to setting a new goal of 200 million Covid-19 vaccinations in his first 100 days, President Biden outlined other indicators of progress on his 65th day in office.? On school reopening, Biden cited a report out this week from the Department of Education that shows nearly half of K-8 schools are open C a step toward his goal of getting a majority of K-8 schools fully open in the first 100 days.? ＾Not yet a majority, but we¨re really close, and I believe in the 35 days left to go we¨ll meet that goal as well,￣ he said.? He also noted that more than 100 million $1,400 economic impact payments have landed in Americans¨ bank accounts as a result of the $1.9 trillion Covid relief package.? ＾Real money, in people¨s pockets ！?bringing relief instantly almost, and millions more will be getting their money very soon,￣ he said.? Approximately 127 million stimulus payments worth around $325 billion have been sent to Americans under the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration announced Wednesday. Biden also cited ＾new sighs of hope￣ for the economy, noting that ＾a majority of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projection on the economic growth that¨s going to take place this year￣ to over 6% GDP growth. He also pointed to Thursday¨s unemployment numbers. Claims fell by nearly 100,000, Biden said, ＾the first time in a year the number has fallen below the pre-pandemic high.￣?

"India records spike in Covid-19 cases as several variants detected, prompting fears of a second wave",26/3/2021,"The country has been reporting more than 35,000 new cases daily for over a week in a recent surge in cases after they fell in January and February this year. 
Randeep Guleria, director at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, told CNN on Wednesday that ""it is the beginning of a second wave.""
The rise in cases comes as the country's top researchers announced that there are nearly 800 variants of concern present in the country. 
The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics -- which has been carrying out genome sequencing and analysis of coronavirus strains since December -- says 771 cases of variants of concern have been detected in India. Most of the cases are the coronavirus variant first identified in the UK, according to a statement from the Indian Ministry of Health on Wednesday. 
While the Health Ministry has not correlated these to the recent rise in cases, these variants have been primarily detected in states such as Punjab and Maharashtra, two states that the health ministry has called states of ""grave concern,"" given that they are contributing to most of the nation's case load.
Guleria said the emergence of the more infectious UK variant in some states may be one of the factors contributing to the recent surge in case numbers.  
The Health Ministry has said ""such mutations confer immune escape and increased infectivity,"" while adding that further analysis is being conducted. 
The country's first wave of infections started climbing last summer and peaked in September, with numbers slowly declining since then. By February, the number of daily cases had fallen by nearly 90%, to about 10,000 a day.

But by the start of March, it became clear that cases were slowly on the increase again -- and they have exploded in the past few weeks.
India has now reported a total of more than 11.7 million cases and 160,000 related deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Guleria said the second wave ""is something that has already been seen in many European countries; we seem to be following them.""
A number of factors are contributing to that rise, Guleria explained. 
""One of the factors is that today it's been one year since India had the lockdown and there are people who seem to have gone into Covid fatigue,"" he said, adding that ""you see that in the community, when you go out, wearing a mask has become less and less. 
""We see crowds developing, partying, a lot of marriage ceremonies are happening in India,"" he added.
Variants and mutations
All viruses evolve over time, and sometimes make changes when they replicate, causing mutations. Some mutations have little effect -- but others could make the variant more easily transmissible, or cause infections with more severe symptoms.
From around 10,787 samples analyzed by the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics from 18 states, 771 cases of variants of concern were detected, the majority of which were the UK strain, according to the Ministry of Health. Thirty-four were the variant first identified in South Africa and one was variant P.1 from Brazil.
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare also said it has found a variant with mutations that don't match previously identified variants of concern.
It's not unusual to see multiple mutations in one variant. ""All of these viruses (variants) which we are dealing with are already mutants,"" said virologist T Jacob John. The strain that became globally prevalent was already different from the first strain that originated in Wuhan, China, he added.
The strain first found in the UK, the B.1.1.7 variant, has 23 mutations compared to the original strain found in Wuhan, according to the American Society of Microbiology. 
The Brazil variant known as P.1 has 17 mutations, and the South Africa variant known as B.1.351 also has multiple mutations, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

How dangerous a mutation is depends on where in the virus it's happening. For instance, the South Africa variant has mutations that change the structure of the spike protein, which appear to affect the receptor binding domain -- the part of the spike protein most important for attaching to and infecting cells. Researchers are now investigating whether it could help the virus partly escape the effects of vaccines.
Guleria cautioned that a new variant was not necessarily cause for alarm, since researchers are still investigating the effect of the mutations.
""They are not clear as to what is the significance of this,"" he said. ""Does it have clinical significance or is it just an observation? And that has to be linked to epidemiological data, which is what is being done.""
One question is which variants -- and which mutations -- might be able to evade the effects of our existing vaccines. 
""If somebody was infected with coronavirus six months ago, that person is immune to the non-mutated coronavirus,"" John said. ""But is the person still immune against the variants? (That has to be) studied.""
India's vaccination drive
In the meantime, Indian authorities are working to control the spike by implementing new restrictions and stepping up the country's vaccine program. 
India is administering two vaccines domestically. One is Covishield, a vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and produced by the Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine maker. The other is India's first homegrown coronavirus vaccine, Covaxin, developed jointly by Bharat Biotech and the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research.
So far, India has administered more than 50 million doses of vaccines, with more than 8.1 million people fully vaccinated, according to Johns Hopkins University.
The Serum Institute of India not only produces most of the vaccines for India -- it is also responsible for many of the vaccines distributed to the rest of the world. In September last year, SII pledged to manufacture and deliver 200 million doses for COVAX -- a WHO vaccine alliance set up to ensure fair access to Covid-19 vaccines.
But SII has had to halt or delay its exports several times in recent months as global and domestic demand surged.

On January 4, India restricted the export of the AstraZeneca vaccine produced by SII until at least March. ""We were given a restricted license only to give it and provide it to the government of India because they want to prioritize for the most vulnerable and needy segments first,"" SII CEO Adar Poonawalla said at the time. ""The only condition is that we can only supply to the government of India, we can't sell it in the private market, and we can't export it.""
Thursday, Reuters reported that India would likely delay deliveries of AstraZeneca vaccines to COVAX, citing UNICEF. India had put a temporary hold on all major exports of AstraZeneca shots made by SII to meet domestic demand, according to Reuters. 
CNN has reached out to SII, UNICEF and the Ministry of External Affairs for comment, but has not yet received a response.
The Ministry of Home Affairs also introduced new infection control guidelines Tuesday that will be in place until the end of April. Some of the measures include quickly isolating positive cases and tracing their contacts within 72 hours. 
Several cities and states including Mumbai, Delhi and Odisha have banned gatherings during Holi, the upcoming festival of colors, on March 28.

"Chinese hackers targeted Uyghurs living in US, Facebook security team finds",26/3/2021,"""They targeted activists, journalists and dissidents among Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities from Xinjiang in China primarily living abroad in Turkey, Kazakhstan, the United States and other countries,"" Facebook said in a post Wednesday detailing its findings about the cyber espionage campaign.
The hackers infected targets' electronic devices with malware ""to enable surveillance,"" Facebook (FB) said. In some cases, the hackers compromised or impersonated news websites popular among Uyghurs to secretly install spying software. 
""This group used fake accounts on Facebook to create fictitious personas posing as journalists, students, human rights advocates or members of the Uyghur community to build trust with people they targeted and trick them into clicking on malicious links,"" the company said. 
Some of Facebook's finding benefited from research by FireEye, a cybersecurity company, Facebook said.
In January, the United States officially determined that China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims and ethnic and religious minority groups who live in the northwestern region of Xinjiang. (The Chinese government denied this assertion, calling it a lie.)
The US State Department has previously estimated as many as 2 million Uyghurs, as well as members of other Muslim minority groups, have been detained in internment camps in the region. 
Facebook did not point the blame directly at the government in Beijing but said the hackers ""had the hallmarks of a well-resourced and persistent operation."" (Hackers linked to the Chinese government previously hacked iPhones and Android devices to target Uyghurs.)
The hacking groups identified as being behind the latest campaign are known in the cybersecurity industry as ""Evil Eye"" and ""Earth Empusa"" and have been involved in previous spying campaigns, according to Facebook. 
Facebook's announcement comes a day before CEO Mark Zuckerberg is set to appear before Congress, alongside the heads of Twitter and Google. Zuckerberg is expected to be asked about the role his platform may have played in fueling the January 6th riot at the US Capitol, among other issues.
Facebook and other social media platforms were widely criticized for allowing Russian trolls to pose as Americans online in the run-up to the 2016 election. Since then, Facebook has publicly called out some governments and other entities it finds using its platform for nefarious purposes.

Hong Kong Disneyland's new castle is an architectural vision of diversity,26/3/2021,,"Much has changed in the 55 years since Walt Disney died -- not just in the fortunes of his brand, now one of the world's most influential corporations, but in the characters it creates and the values it promotes. So, when the company went about building a new fairytale castle at Hong Kong Disneyland, it took into consideration something that would have barely factored into discussions when its first resort opened in Anaheim, California, in 1955: diversity. The new Castle of Magical Dreams, completed in November and reopened last month after Hong Kong's Covid-19 restrictions loosened, nods to the wider variety of female characters now featured in Disney movies. Unlike the Cinderella Castles in Florida and Tokyo or the Sleeping Beauty Castles in California and Paris -- all of which were partly inspired by the 19th century Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, Germany -- the design represents not just one heroine but over a dozen.  The new structure was built atop the existing Sleeping Beauty Castle, the centerpiece of Hong Kong Disneyland since the resort opened in 2005. As such, Princess Aurora still holds a special place in the new castle, with a tower dedicated to the ""Sleeping Beauty"" protagonist standing the tallest.  But the other 12 towers pay homage to a variety of different princesses, queens and heroines, including historical or folk figures fictionalized by Disney, like the Chinese warrior Mulan and the Native American figure Pocahontas. (Anna and Elsa from ""Frozen"" share a tower between them).  Diversity is also reflected in the eclectic architecture, which sees rose gold domes mixed with embossed turrets and spires. Disney's so-called ""Imagineers"" -- the artists, designers and engineers behind the theme parks -- incorporated the characters' storylines into the design of each tower, such as an apple lattice pattern in Snow White's (""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs""), scalloped detailing for Ariel's (""Little Mermaid"") and a water lily motif for Tiana's (""The Princess and the Frog""). Elsewhere, the structure boasts gold-tipped finials, stained-glass rose windows and columns with hand-carved embellishments. Design challenges Hong Kong's original Sleeping Beauty Castle was directly inspired by the first Disneyland resort in California. This castle had been dreamed up in the 1950s by Walt Disney, who envisioned an amusement park for the entire family, complete with a replica of an old-fashioned American main street and distinct ""dreamlands.""  To honor its founder's vision, Disney decided to preserve Hong Kong's Sleeping Beauty Castle when it embarked on a major expansion in 2016 -- instead of demolishing it entirely, designers built atop and around it. ""The original castle is a foundation of Disney, so we wanted to build upon that,"" said Hilcia Pena, a senior architect at Walt Disney Imagineering (WDI) in a video interview. The result is a palimpsest of sorts, where versions of many castles -- the California original, Hong Kong's 2005 replica and the brand-new Castle of Magical Dreams -- come together as one. After the multi-year, 10.9 billion Hong Kong dollar ($1.4 million) expansion, which also saw the park welcome multiple new attractions, the re-imagined castle is over twice the height of the old one. According to Pena, this means that the castle is no longer dwarfed by the mountainous landscape of Lantau, the island where Hong Kong Disneyland is located. Imagineers even used helium-filled balloons to help them visualize the height of the prospective structure in relationship to its backdrop. They then used 3D technology to model how the old castle and new castle would connect. One of the biggest challenges was finding a way to build on top of the existing castle while keeping the park open to visitors. The team landed on modular construction, which sees individual parts of a building, or ""modules,"" constructed in a factory before being transported to the site. In this instance, the castle was built from 15 large parts, each prefabricated, painted and assembled off site. Individual towers and other components were then shipped in and craned into place over a period of three months. Together, the towers form a mosaic of cultures through color, symbols and patterns, with each offering different elements of their respective characters' worlds. Jasmine's fuchsia tower is embellished with an Arabic fabric pattern and crowned with a turquoise dome. Mulan's tower is embossed with a cherry blossom motif. And Merida's tower is replete with Celtic patterns, a reference to the four clans in the 2012 movie ""Brave."" Each tower culminates in a gold-tipped finial unique to each character: a golden seashell for Ariel and an enchanted rose for Belle. Meanwhile inside, guests will find 13 columns topped with details dedicated to the protagonists' friends, like Ariel's Flounder and Sebastian, Merida's triplet brothers and Moana's pet pig Pua and rooster HeiHei. ""We're understanding different parts of the world, so we can't just focus on one group, or one princess or one location,"" said Pena. ""Our stories continue to grow, and we get to learn about different cultures around the world. So how do we put that into the buildings and stories we try to tell?""  The only direct depictions of the 14 heroines are found inside, where Imagineers designed bronze statues of each one. Their evolution -- from Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, whose lives rely on a man's kiss, to assured and empowered characters like Merida and Moana -- tells a story about how Disney has repositioned itself over the years. But even the older characters' statues have been designed with contemporary values in mind. ""Instead of portraying them in a very submissive way, we portrayed them (all) as powerful women in a very engaging pose,"" said Amanda Chiu, a producer with WDI Asia, pointing to the depiction of Ariel standing proudly as she exercises her newfound freedom and Jasmine riding solo on the magic carpet. Local inspiration  In line with the characters' origins, Imagineers drew inspiration from Europe, China and the Pacific Islands. ""A European castle has one style and the same detailing everywhere,"" said Pena. ""This one has different architectural styles -- even the domes are very different in style."" It is fitting, perhaps, that such an eclectic castle exists in Hong Kong, one of Asia's more diverse cities. ""Hong Kong is a city of rich cultural fabric and cultural diversity,"" said Chiu, who was born and raised in the territory.  As well as taking inspiration from around the world, Disneyland Hong Kong was also built according to the principles of feng shui, an important aspect of design and architecture in parts of Asia. Based on an ancient Chinese system, the ancient practice involves positioning objects or buildings in relation to one another and their surroundings to encourage happiness and good fortune. In 2005, for instance, the angle of the resort's front gate was shifted by 12 degrees in the belief that it would keep positive energy, or ""chi,"" flowing through the park. Feng shui also informed the design of the new castle. ""Feng shui is about the balance of the five elements,"" said Chiu, referring to wood, fire, earth, metal and water. ""We want to draw on that harmony and apply that to castle."" Wood and earth are symbolized by the castle's landscaping -- a mix of living plants and artificial foliage -- which helps it blend in with its surroundings; fire will be used in pyrotechnic shows at night; metal can be found in the towers' gold finials; and water is used in the castle's moat and dancing fountains. ""All of these elements come together in good harmony,"" Chiu added.  While still rooted in tradition of sorts, Hong Kong's Castle of Magical Dreams nonetheless symbolizes Disney's attempts to modernize. With an increasingly global customer base, and several resorts in Asia, diversity might not just be a matter of values but good business, too.",architecture,STYLE
"Biden, a President who doesn't insult people -- or our intelligence",25/3/2021,"Biden made news by answering a question he had dodged before -- the one about a second term (he is 78). ""My plan,"" he told reporters, ""is to run for reelection in 2024."" He also made news on the pandemic, announcing he is doubling the initial goal of administering 100 million vaccines in his first 100 days, to 200 million doses.
And over roughly one hour, the President took tough questions from journalists without making any significant mistakes or verbal stumbles, defended his administration vigorously, and showed a deep and nuanced understanding of a wide range of issues -- and the politics needed for results.
""I got elected to solve problems,"" he declared at the outset, explaining why he has focused on the country's most urgent -- the pandemic and the economy -- while preparing to address more long-term challenges, such as gun control, immigration, climate change and voting rights. 
As it happens, crises on those fronts are not waiting for him to finish work on his top priorities. And neither were the reporters he faced.
But from America's border crisis to China, from the federal budget to the global contests between democracy and autocracy, he avoided easy answers, articulating complexities and laying out reasonable approaches. He didn't promise to solve it all, but vowed to make improvements.
Some of the toughest questioning centered on the surge of migrants at the southern border, where thousands of unaccompanied children await processing in overcrowded conditions. When asked if he found this acceptable, he looked almost offended by the question, and was defensive, saying his administration is working hard on rebuilding facilities that were dismantled by the previous presidency. 
But he offered no apologies for not sending the children back across the border. ""The idea that I'm going to say ... if an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we're going to let him starve to death and stay on the other side,"" he declared, ""I'm not going to do it."" 
 
In a remarkable display of compassion unlike any I recall hearing from another US president -- and in striking contrast to his predecessor -- he described the excruciating decision process that would lead a parent to send her child alone on a thousand-mile journey to an unknown fate. ""What a desperate act to have to take,"" he said. ""The circumstances must be horrible.""
People leave, he said, because of earthquakes, floods, lack of food, gang violence. He plans, he said, to help address those problems inside Central America, and to make sure the funding for solutions bypasses corrupt governments.
Biden showed an interesting perspective on the filibuster, the rule requiring 60 votes to pass major legislation in the Senate, which is complicating his legislative goals. He said he's inclined to go back to the old method in place when he came to the Senate -- ""120 years ago,"" he joked. Back then, a filibuster required senators to speak until they couldn't go any longer. When asked if he thought the filibuster is a relic of the racist Jim Crow era, he said yes, but explained he also understands what is possible in politics. Still, he said the rule is being ""abused in a gigantic way,"" showing openness to its repeal.
The President used some of his most passionate language to attack Republican efforts to restrict voting rights -- as in a bill that passed the Georgia House Thursday. He called the strategy ""un-American,"" ""sick,"" saying even Republican voters find the move ""despicable,"" and vowing to do everything in his power to counter it.
He called out the hypocrisy of Republicans suddenly concerned about the size of the federal deficit after having expressed no qualms about massive tax cuts that so lavishly have benefited the rich. ""When the federal budget is saving people's lives, they don't think it's such a good idea,"" he said, ""when it's feathering the nests of the wealthiest Americans,"" they don't object.
On foreign policy, Biden explained that the ongoing friction between China and even Russia is part of a larger challenge: a contest between democracy and autocracy. He laid out the multifaceted rivalry between China and the United States, noting that trade -- the near-obsessive focus of former President Donald Trump -- is only one area where the two countries are at odds. 
Rebuilding relationships with allies will be a key element of Biden's approach, especially after Trump frayed so many long-standing strategic ties. (Looking at his wristwatch, Biden told reporters that he was about to go on a virtual meeting with 27 heads of state.)
The President has expressed his wholehearted embrace of America as global leader, and on Thursday restated his plan to convene a summit of democracies in the United States, to ""discuss the future.""
Biden's first news conference was not just a startling departure from his predecessor's -- he never insulted anyone, didn't praise himself, and spoke in full, coherent sentences. It was a strong performance by any standard. Anyone who watched after listening to the absurd claims in right-wing media that Biden suffers from cognitive troubles could see that the smear is patently false.
For most Americans, who approve of the job Biden is doing and want the country to do well, this was a most welcome and reassuring 60 minutes.
","Anyone hoping President Joe Biden's first formal news conference Thursday would produce a series of gaffes and misstatements must be deeply disappointed. Americans who want a competent, coherent, focused President should feel reassured. Biden made news by answering a question he had dodged before -- the one about a second term (he is 78).

The President used some of his most passionate language to attack Republican efforts to restrict voting rights -- as in a bill that passed the Georgia House Thursday. He called the strategy ""un-American,"" ""sick,"" saying even Republican voters find the move ""despicable,"" and vowing to do everything in his power to counter it. He called out the hypocrisy of Republicans suddenly concerned about the size of the federal deficit after having expressed no qualms about massive tax cuts that so lavishly have benefited the rich. ""When the federal budget is saving people's lives, they don't think it's such a good idea,"" he said, ""when it's feathering the nests of the wealthiest Americans,"" they don't object. On foreign policy, Biden explained that the ongoing friction between China and even Russia is part of a larger challenge: a contest between democracy and autocracy. He laid out the multifaceted rivalry between China and the United States, noting that trade -- the near-obsessive focus of former President Donald Trump -- is only one area where the two countries are at odds.  Rebuilding relationships with allies will be a key element of Biden's approach, especially after Trump frayed so many long-standing strategic ties. (Looking at his wristwatch, Biden told reporters that he was about to go on a virtual meeting with 27 heads of state.) The President has expressed his wholehearted embrace of America as global leader, and on Thursday restated his plan to convene a summit of democracies in the United States, to ""discuss the future."" Biden's first news conference was not just a startling departure from his predecessor's -- he never insulted anyone, didn't praise himself, and spoke in full, coherent sentences. It was a strong performance by any standard. Anyone who watched after listening to the absurd claims in right-wing media that Biden suffers from cognitive troubles could see that the smear is patently false. For most Americans, who approve of the job Biden is doing and want the country to do well, this was a most welcome and reassuring 60 minutes.",opinions,OPINION
Suez Canal traffic jam blocks the world's jugular vein,25/3/2021,"This is not a story you hear every day; maritime logistics do not cross most people's minds often, let alone wind up in the national news. But they are nonetheless pivotal to global trade. This story provides a stark reminder of the tenuous nature of our maritime global supply chain and the dangers to maritime choke points. 
The closure of the Suez Canal has massive ramifications. Every day, 3.3 million tons of cargo traverse this waterway. On average, 50 ships arrive at the ports waiting to embark on their day-long passage. As Ever Given remains firmly across the canal, shipping companies will have to fathom the option of sending ships around Africa, adding as much as two weeks to their journey. All of this means a slow down in the delivery of goods, fuel and essential material between Asia and Europe. Factories depending on parts from Asia may have to close, and essential goods and products to battle Covid-19 may be inaccessible. Fuel prices, already high in Europe, could further increase. 
A failure of machinery, human error or natural events -- high winds and reduced visibility -- may have caused Ever Given to run ashore in the Suez Canal.  
But its impact will resonate far from its banks as it has blocked the jugular of one of the largest trade routes in human history. 
The Suez Canal was opened in November 1869 to great fanfare after 10 years of excavation. A joint endeavor by France and Great Britain, it provided a shorter route to Asia than having to circumnavigate Africa. Connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean via the Red Sea, the vital waterway was essential to maritime commerce. In the First World War, Turkish forces tried to attack the canal from the east, and in the Second World War, General Erwin Rommel and the Afrika Korps aimed to do the same from the west.  
In 1956, after the war and during the height of anti-colonialism, Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the canal, precipitating the Suez Crisis with Israel, France and Great Britain. This resulted in its closing until March 1957. Then, in June 1967, the Six-Day War led to the Suez Canal becoming the border between a warring Egypt and Israel for eight years. The outbreak of the conflict found more than a dozen ships -- the Yellow Fleet -- caught in the canal and trapped for the duration. The crews of this international fleet formed the ""Great Bitter Lake Association,"" and even competed in their own version of the Olympics. The ships remained until 1975.
This closure forced a revolution in maritime transportation with the creation of supertankers -- very large crude carriers. With the canal closed, ship designers built ships that were too large for the Suez Canal and had to sail around the Cape of Good Hope. This economy of scale in transportation has evolved from supertankers to mega cruise ships and container ships such as Ever Given. In 1956, American Malcolm McLean developed the concept of intermodalism.  Instead of individual goods being loaded into a truck, then offloaded at a port, and then loaded into a ship and the process reversed, he developed the modular shipping container, which allowed for containers filled with goods to be transferred, streamlining the process. When SS Ideal X sailed from Newark, New Jersey, to Houston, Texas, with 58 containers on its deck, McLean could not have envisioned a ship the size and scale of Ever Given. 
By 2020, containerized cargo made up nearly 40% of the 11 billion tons shipped on the world's oceans annually. The movement of goods by container has continually grown except during the economic recession of 2008 and the tariff fight between China and the United States along with the Covid-19 crisis in 2020.  One of the main arteries for this trade runs between Eastern Asia and Europe. 
The 23 million containers that moved between Asia and Europe in 2020 sailed through some of history's most contested waters, such as the Strait of Singapore and Malacca Strait, the Bab-el-Mandeb, the Straits of Gibraltar and the most relevant today, the Suez Canal. 
Great Britain controlled all these maritime choke points during its imperial height. It allowed Britain to influence ocean commerce and trade. Today, many of these are patrolled and regulated by international conventions and patrolled by navies, but the Suez Canal is wholly owned and controlled by Egypt. 
","The Suez Canal made headlines on Wednesday. A 59-foot-wide container ship called the Ever Given rammed into the eastern bank of the 120-mile-long Suez Canal. Traveling at a speed of 13 knots (15 mph), the 1,300 foot, 200,000-ton ultra large container ship came to a sudden stop with her bow aground in Asia and her astern at rest in Africa, creating a blockage in a waterway that sees 12% of the world commerce pass through it every year. As of Thursday, tugboats are still working to dislodge the Ever Given.  This is not a story you hear every day; maritime logistics do not cross most people's minds often, let alone wind up in the national news. But they are nonetheless pivotal to global trade.

Speed read Biden's news conference,25/3/2021,"The questions mostly focused on the immigration crisis at the border, but ran the gamut from Biden's plans for dealing China, running again in 2024 and protecting voting rights. 
What's below is the speed read version of the hourlong event, with key excerpts from each of his answers along with what they meant.
Question 1: Relations with Republicans in Congress 
Subtext: Will you back ending the filibuster? First, Biden answered that he's going to continue to focus on Covid and the economy.
BIDEN: The fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance, whether they're going to lose a family member, whether they're going to be in a position where they're going to lose their home because they can't pay their mortgage or the millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to pay their rent.
But he thinks Republicans have a choice to make.
BIDEN: Here's the deal. I think my Republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together or decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to -- is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division, but I'm not going to do that. I'm just going to move forward and take these things as they come. 
And the bottom line is, Biden thinks he can get a lot done without Republicans, and pointed to his Covid relief bill as evidence.
BIDEN: All I know, I've been hired to solve problems, to solve problems, not create division. 
Question 2: Plans for dealing with the immigration crisis
Biden said former President Donald Trump tried to dismantle the US immigration and border system and disputed that there's a larger influx of migrants now that he's President.
BIDEN: What we're doing now is attempting to rebuild, rebuild the system that can accommodate what is happening today. And I'd like to think it's because I'm a nice guy, but it's not, it's because of what's happened every year. 
He said most of the kids at the border are teenagers, not young kids, that most people apprehended are sent back to their home country and that his administration is working to place them with family members in the US much more quickly. He also said he's working with Mexico to take back more of the families who are detained at the border.
Question 3: Biden's position on filibuster reform
After rattling off statistics about the rise in filibusters in recent years, Biden said he supports a return to the so-called ""talking filibuster.""
BIDEN: It used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down and were able to break the filibuster and get a quorum and vote. 
He added that he'll go further if he has to. 
BIDEN: We're ready to get a lot done. If we have to, if there's complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we'll have to go beyond what I'm talking about.
Question 4: A follow-up on filibuster reform
Biden was in the Senate for a very long time, but now he's President -- and he made clear that fixing the Senate is not his problem.  
BIDEN: Our preoccupation with the filibuster is totally legitimate. But in the meantime, we've got a lot we can do while we're talking about what we're going to do about the filibuster. 
Question 5: What to do about kids at the border
ABC's Cecilia Vega told Biden she met a 9-year-old at the border whose mother sent him specifically because Biden would be more humane.
BIDEN: Look, the idea that I'm going to say, which I would never do, if an unaccompanied child ends up at the border we're just going to let them starve to death and stay on the other side ... no previous administration did that either, except Trump. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it.
In Vega's follow-up, she noted that kids are sleeping on floors and aren't seeing the sun. So, she asked: Is that acceptable?
BIDEN: Is it acceptable to me? Come on. That's why we're going to be moving 1,000 of those kids out quickly. That's why I got Fort Bliss opened up. That's why I've been working from the moment this started happening to try to find additional access for children to be able to safely, not just children, but particularly children, to be able to safely be housed while we follow through on the rest of what's happening. That is totally unacceptable.
Question 6: Will US troops be out of Afghanistan by May 1?
Biden has been navigating how to meet a May 1 deadline to withdraw all US troops from the country that was agreed between former President Donald Trump and the Taliban.
BIDEN: The answer is that it's going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline. Just in terms of tactical reasons, hard to get those troops out. ... But it is not my intention to stay there for a long time.
Follow-up: Will there be US troops in Afghanistan next year?
BIDEN: I can't picture that being the case.
Question 7: Access to border facilities housing kids
The Biden administration has not allowed journalists to independently visit facilities housing kids, but several lawmakers have visited them. Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar earlier this week provided CNN with photos revealing the conditions for dozens of children and adults in an overflow facility in Donna, Texas.
Biden said his administration needed more time.
BIDEN: I will commit to transparency, and as soon as I'm in a position to be able to implement what we're doing right now. One of the reasons I haven't gone down, my chief folks have gone down, is I don't want to become the issue. I don't want to be, you know, bringing all the Secret Service and everybody with me to get in the way. So, this is being set up and you'll have full access to everything once we get this thing moving.
Follow-up: Did you unwind Trump border policies too quickly?
BIDEN: Rolling back the policies of separating children from their mothers, I make no apology for that. Rolling back the policies of ""Remain in Mexico,"" sitting on the edge of the Rio Grande in the muddy circumstance with not enough to eat, I make no apologies for that. I make no apologies for ending programs that did not exist before Trump became president that have an incredibly negative impact on the law, international law, as well as on human dignity. And so, I make no apologies for that. 
Question 8: Biden's red line on North Korea
On Wednesday, North Korea launched two ballistic missiles. South Korea's joint chiefs of staff said in a statement that two short-range missiles had been fired from the Hamju area of South Hamgyong province toward the sea, off North Korea's east coast, at 7:06 a.m. and 7:25 a.m. Thursday local time.
BIDEN: We're consulting with our allies and partners and there will be responses if they choose to escalate. We will respond accordingly, but I'm also prepared for some form of diplomacy.
But it has to be conditioned upon the end result of de-nuclearization.
Follow-up: What do you mean by diplomacy?
Biden didn't answer directly, but he did agree that North Korea is his top foreign policy item to watch.
Question 9: The fight over voting rights 
One reason the filibuster matters is because Democrats want to pass voting rights legislation in Congress -- in part to counter Republican moves in the states to add restrictions. 
As the press conference was getting underway, Georgia's Republican-controlled state legislature was moving ahead with a bill that would set new rules on voting in a state that was pivotal to Biden's victory -- as well as to sealing Democratic control of the US Senate. 
Conservative groups nationally have unified behind the effort, drawing comparisons to Jim Crow from Black activists -- a precedent that Biden also brought up.
BIDEN: What I'm worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It's sick. It's sick. Deciding in some states that you can not bring water to people standing in line waiting to vote? Deciding that you're going to end voting at 5 o'clock when working people are just getting off work? Deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances?...  
I'm convinced that we'll be able to stop this, because it is the most pernicious thing. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle. 
Follow-up: What can you do besides pass legislation out of Congress? 
BIDEN: The answer is, yes, but I'm not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now. 
Question 10: Running in 2024? 
Trump had already set up a re-election committee at this point in his first term, the questioner noted.
BIDEN: My predecessor needed to. 
My predecessor. Oh, god, I miss him. No, and the answer is yes, my plan is to run for re-election. 
Follow-up: What's the relationship like with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell?
BIDEN: I would like Republican -- elected Republican support, but what I know I have now is I have electoral support from Republican voters. Republican voters agree with what I'm doing. 
Question 11: More on the filibuster
Again, Biden was a creature of the Senate for most of his Washington life, and he has been hesitant about calling for total evisceration of its rules -- even as he agreed that it is a relic of America's racist past. (For more on that, head here.)
The question: Why not get rid of it?
BIDEN: (Long pause) Successful electoral politics is the art of the possible. Let's figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first. It's been abused from the time it came into being by an extreme way in the last 20 years. Let's deal with the abuse first. 
Follow-up: So are you running for re-election?
BIDEN: I said that is my expectation... Look, I don't know where you guys come from, man. I've never been able to travel. I'm a great respecter of fate. I've never been able to plan four and a half, three and a half years ahead for certain. 
Follow-up to the follow-up: Do you think you'll be running against Trump?
BIDEN: I don't even think about -- I have no idea. ... Look, this is -- the way I view things, I become a great respecter of fate in my life. I set a goal that's in front of me to get things done for the people I care most about, which are hard-working, decent American people really having it stuck to them...
I've not been able to unite the Congress but I've been uniting the country. Based on the polling data. We have to come together. We have to ... 
To me it's about just, you know, getting out there, putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to make things better for people. Just hard-working people.
Question 12: China
Biden did not directly answer the question from Bloomberg's Justin Sink, which was about whether he'd lift the tariffs Trump put in place. But he did go in-depth about his conversations with China's President Xi Jinping, pledged to keep the US competitive with China and voiced his commitment to standing up for freedom and his faith in democracy.
BIDEN: I predict to you, your children or grandchildren, are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded, autocracy or democracy, because that is what is at stake. Not just with China. Look around the world. We're in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence ...
This is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies. If you notice, you don't have Russia talking about communism anymore. It's about an autocracy. Demand decisions made by a leader of a country. That's what's at stake here. We got to prove democracy works. 
Question 13: Gun control
It took most of the hour to get to a question connected to the supermarket shooting in Boulder, Colorado, earlier this week, and what Biden plans to do on guns -- which may not be much.
BIDEN: It's a matter of timing. As you've all observed, successful presidents better than me, have been successful in large part because they know how to time what they're doing. Order it. Deciding priorities. What needs to be done. 
Then Biden pivoted to what his priorities are -- including infrastructure.
BIDEN: The next major initiative is, and I'll be announcing it Friday in Pittsburgh in detail, is to rebuild the infrastructure, both physical and technological infrastructure of this country, so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs, really good-paying jobs.
He then described at length how he wants to improve airports, ports, schools, energy efficiency, water availability and more. (Also, he misstated when his trip to Pittsburgh will be -- it's next week.)
Question 14: More on the border crisis
Reporters who have traveled to the border were hard on Biden, who said he has not gone because he doesn't want to create a distraction -- but insisted his administration is going to fix things. 
BIDEN: They're already getting better but they're going to get real, a whole hell of a lot better real quick and we're going to hear some people leaving, okay? We can get this done.
Follow-up: Vice President Kamala Harris is now in charge of diplomatic efforts to stop people from traveling north. But those efforts won't work overnight. 
BIDEN: It's not like somebody sitting on a hand-hewn table in Guatemala or somewhere in Mexico or in Guadalupe saying, 'I got a great idea, let's sell everything we have, give it to a coyote, have him take our kids across the border into a desert where they don't speak the language, won't that be fun? Let's go.' That's not how it happens. People don't want to leave.
He repeated that most of the people arriving at the border are not small children. 
BIDEN: I realize it's much more heart wrenching, and it is, to deal with a 5- and 6- and 7-year-old, but you went down there and you saw the vast majority of these children, 70%, are 16 years old, 17 years old and mostly males. Doesn't make it good, bad, or indifferent, but the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these god-awful facilities that are really little babies, crying all night, there's some, that's true. That's why we've got got to act.
Last follow-up: Has he talked to Republicans about immigration reform?
BIDEN: No, because I know they have to posture for a while. They've sort of got to get it out of their system. This is a -- but I'm ready to work with any Republican who wants to help solve the problem. Or make the situation better. 
And with that, he left.
","President Joe Biden opened his first presidential news conference Thursday with a new promise to get 200 million Covid vaccine shots in American arms by the end of April -- and then spent the rest of the hour defending his administration's immigration policy and teasing openness to ending the Senate filibuster. The questions mostly focused on the immigration crisis at the border, but ran the gamut from Biden's plans for dealing China, running again in 2024 and protecting voting rights.  What's below is the speed read version of the hourlong event, with key excerpts from each of his answers along with what they meant.

BIDEN: What I'm worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It's sick. It's sick. Deciding in some states that you can not bring water to people standing in line waiting to vote? Deciding that you're going to end voting at 5 o'clock when working people are just getting off work? Deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances?...   I'm convinced that we'll be able to stop this, because it is the most pernicious thing. This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle.  Follow-up: What can you do besides pass legislation out of Congress?  BIDEN: The answer is, yes, but I'm not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now.  Question 10: Running in 2024?  Trump had already set up a re-election committee at this point in his first term, the questioner noted. BIDEN:  My predecessor needed to.  My predecessor. Oh, god, I miss him. No, and the answer is yes, my plan is to run for re-election.  Follow-up: What's the relationship like with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell? BIDEN: I would like Republican -- elected Republican support, but what I know I have now is I have electoral support from Republican voters. Republican voters agree with what I'm doing.  Question 11: More on the filibuster Again, Biden was a creature of the Senate for most of his Washington life, and he has been hesitant about calling for total evisceration of its rules -- even as he agreed that it is a relic of America's racist past. (For more on that, head here.) The question: Why not get rid of it? BIDEN: (Long pause) Successful electoral politics is the art of the possible. Let's figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first. It's been abused from the time it came into being by an extreme way in the last 20 years. Let's deal with the abuse first.  Follow-up: So are you running for re-election? BIDEN: I said that is my expectation... Look, I don't know where you guys come from, man. I've never been able to travel. I'm a great respecter of fate. I've never been able to plan four and a half, three and a half years ahead for certain.  Follow-up to the follow-up: Do you think you'll be running against Trump? BIDEN: I don't even think about -- I have no idea. ... Look, this is -- the way I view things, I become a great respecter of fate in my life. I set a goal that's in front of me to get things done for the people I care most about, which are hard-working, decent American people really having it stuck to them... I've not been able to unite the Congress but I've been uniting the country. Based on the polling data. We have to come together. We have to ...

Key takeaways from Biden's first White House news conference,25/3/2021,"He came prepared with a binder of talking points and a goal of staying on message, though at times he meandered and at moments grew defensive. 
The President broke new ground on his views of the Senate filibuster, said he expected to run again in 2024, grew irate at the curtailing of voting rights and downplayed the prospect of withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan by the looming deadline.
At a broader level, however, he provided the American people their first extended look at how their president operates, his grasp of his own power and his views toward the future.
Filibuster reform and bipartisanship

It took three questions, but Biden acknowledged Thursday he was ready to look at reforming the Senate filibuster in a major way -- including going beyond just reverting to the so-called ""standing filibuster.""
""We're going to have to go beyond what I'm talking about,"" he concluded after a lengthy answer about his promises to the American people.
It was a step further than Biden has been willing to go in the past, and reflects the growing recognition that most items on the President's list of priorities -- gun control, immigration, climate change -- have little chance of securing passage in an evenly split Senate.
Biden said he was open to making bigger changes to the Senate rule on issues he called ""elemental"" to democracy such as voting rights, the topic on which he seemed most impassioned.
""I'm convinced that we'll be able to stop this, because it is the most pernicious thing,"" Biden said of attempts by Republican state legislatures to impose new restrictions on voting. ""This makes Jim Crow look like Jim Eagle. I mean, this is gigantic, what they're trying to do. And it cannot be sustained.""
Later, pressed by CNN's Kaitlan Collins if he believed with former President Barack Obama that the filibuster is a remnant of Jim Crow, he said he did.
Biden's had previously sought to strike a delicate balance in weighing in on items like the filibuster, wary of alienating Republicans or coming off as breaking with tradition.
But he seemed less concerned with those matters on Thursday, declaring himself working for the American people and not some vague idea of bipartisanship. Asked about Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who griped on Wednesday he'd only spoken to Biden once since taking office, he shrugged: ""I would expect him to say exactly what he said.""
Pressed later about his reelection plans, he openly wondered whether the Republican Party would even exist in three-and-a-half years.
At his back is polling showing many Republicans supportive of his Covid-19 relief bill, which no Republicans in Congress supported. Biden acknowledged that fact, and said it mattered more to him that Republicans in the country backed his agenda than Republicans in the Capitol.
""I've not been able to unite the Congress but I've been able to unite the country, based on the polling data,"" he said.
Temperament

People who have worked alongside Biden often note he has a temper that sometimes flares when he's challenged, along with a penchant for long-windedness. Both were on display Thursday. 
He asked one reporter ""that's a serious question?"" when pressed on conditions at border facilities and chafed at questions about his political future.
""Look, I don't know where you guys come from, man,"" he said.
Biden eventually did say he planned to run for reelection in 2024 -- something he hadn't said before -- but acknowledged that events may intervene.
""I'm a great respecter of fate. I've never been able to plan four and a half, three and a half years ahead for certain,"" he said.
The question about his political plans put Biden's age in sharper focus than it has been so far in his presidency, and at moments during his news conference it was clear the 78-year-old Biden was relying on scripted talking points.
At other moments he trailed off, abruptly ending answers when he seemed to be meandering.
""Am I giving you too long an answer?"" he asked several minutes into an answer on immigration. ""Maybe I should stop there.""
Still, Biden demonstrated a firm grasp on the wide array of issues confronting his presidency and seemed impassioned by topics ranging from voting rights to infrastructure. He was also self-deprecating at points and seemed to genuinely respect the assembled press corps, a sharp break from his predecessor.
At times he did grow defensive, particularly when pressed on his administration's record in stemming the surge of migrants on the southern border. His advisers do not believe occasional flashes of anger are necessary a bad thing for Biden.
But his news conference was not marked by open hostility in the same way President Donald Trump's were. Biden sarcastically mourned Trump's absence.
""My predecessor,"" he said. ""Oh, God, I miss him."" 
Covid-19 pandemic

Biden has relentlessly focused on combating the coronavirus pandemic since taking office. One of the reasons a news conference was put off so long, according to White House officials, was that Biden's time was overwhelmingly preoccupied by the response.
Yet the news conference came at a moment when other issues were swirling. Biden entered the event hoping to turn attention back to his Covid-19 response by naming a new goal on vaccinations -- 200 million in his first 100 days. And later he sought to frame his entire early presidency around the pandemic response.
""When I took office I decided that it was a fairly basic, simple proposition. I got elected to solve problems,"" he said.
It turned out his desire to insert his pandemic response back into the conversation was warranted; it did not arise in any of the questions posed by reporters.
Later, it was evident that Biden's next priority -- a package on infrastructure -- is set to dominate his forthcoming legislative agenda. He was asked a question about gun control in the wake of two mass shootings that killed 18 people over the past week.
But he quickly acknowledged that wasn't where he is headed in Congress.
""Successful presidents, better than me, have been successful in large part because they've know how to time what they're doing,"" he said, launching in a lengthy answer that went from improving drinking water to removing asbestos to making buildings more efficient.
Foreign policy

For a president whose ""first love"" is foreign policy, according to aides, the issue has not been central to the early part of his presidency.
That seems due to change in the coming weeks as he faces decisions on withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, punishing Russia for its role in a massive cyber attack, responding to provocations from North Korea and developing a strategy to deal with an emboldened China.
On Thursday, Biden provided some new insights into how he views his role on the global stage. He suggested a renewed focus on improving relationships with American allies after a tumultuous four years under Trump.
But he also acknowledged certain areas where he finds himself confronting the very same issues as his predecessor without a new approach.
He acknowledged that it would be ""hard"" to meet a May 1 deadline for withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan, but said he could not picture troops there next year.
He said Wednesday's ballistic missile tests from North Korea violated UN Security Council resolutions, and vowed a response if the situation escalates, but said -- like Trump -- he was willing to give diplomacy a chance if conditioned ""on the end result of denuclearization.""
And though he declined to answer specific questions about Trump-era tariffs on China, saying they ""only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with China really is about,"" his administration has left them in place for now, believing they provide leverage for future negotiations.
Asked if North Korea was still the top foreign policy issue he was currently facing -- something Obama warned Trump would be the case when he entered office in 2016 -- Biden said it was.
""Yes,"" he said, without elaborating.
Immigration

The most sustained line of questioning at Thursday's news conference was around the issue of immigration at the southern border, which the administration has refused to define as a ""crisis.""
Biden also sought to downplay the number of migrants crossing into the United States, saying it a seasonal increase that mapped with previous years. He sharply rejected suggestions that more migrants were coming to the United States because of a set of rule changes he enacted that allow some unaccompanied minors to remain in the country.
He said he would never tell migrant child arriving in the country along ""we're just gonna let him starve to death and stand on the other side.""
""No previous administrations did that either, except Trump,"" he said. ""I'm not going to do it.""
At its heart, Biden's argument is that the current immigration situation was aggravated by policies enacted under his predecessor, which he said made it harder to house and process migrant children. 
He said with more time to enact new policies and rebuild the processing system, the current situation will be alleviated. And he claimed he'd directed top officials to speed up the pace at which relatives of migrant children are contacted to move them from government shelters.
""It's going to get a whole hell of a lot better real quick or we're going to hear some people leaving,"" he said. ""We can get this done. We're going to get it done.""
","Convening his first formal news conference Thursday, President Joe Biden stepped into a swirl of issues that have bubbled up at the two-month mark of his presidency, which has been almost exclusively focused until now on confronting the coronavirus pandemic. He came prepared with a binder of talking points and a goal of staying on message, though at times he meandered and at moments grew defensive.

What Europe expects from Joe Biden,25/3/2021,"Are the Europeans ready to trust Biden when he says ""America is back""?
""They want to trust him and they want America back. Europeans also know the US has a lot of work to do to put its own house in order. Biden has recognized, especially in his article in Foreign Affairs, that a strong America abroad requires a strong America at home, with a great deal of catching-up to do. His domestic policy proposals show that.""
Does Europe really believe the Trump era is over ！ or are there fears that the populist tide could rise again?
""Yes to both. The Trump era is over for four years but Europeans know that more people voted for Trump than any other US presidential candidate ever, except Biden himself. It's obvious to everyone in policy circles in Europe that America's divisions are deep and difficult. Biden isn't doing 'America First' but his policy is 'Americans First.' That makes total sense. It's why he was elected. Europeans get that.
""Europeans understand that Biden's action in the world is going to be inspired as much by national security adviser Jake Sullivan's 'foreign policy for the middle class' as by Secretary of State Tony Blinken's 'stronger with allies' ！ which aren't at all incompatible.
""Nothing would make the Europeans happier than a strong, reliable United States as long as it isn't undermining fundamental European interests.""
That's where China comes in -- there's been a lot of talk in Washington of enlisting Europe alongside America's Asian allies in a broad front against Beijing. But the EU's decision to conclude a trade partnership with China just before Biden took office didn't go down too well in Washington.
""There is a view in Europe that some people in Washington would be happy to adopt a 'new Cold War' mentality because it makes life simpler. But it's more nuanced than that. The EU policy paper on China ！ across a spectrum from cooperation partner to strategic adversary ！ as well as Tony Blinken's policy statements, show Europe and the US can find common ground: You compete where you need to compete, you hold China accountable where you need to hold them accountable, which is what Biden did the other day, and you cooperate where you should cooperate ！ not least on climate change.""
What could fracture such a common approach?
""I don't think there will be a structural divergence between the US and Europe on China. And most issues on which the US and Europe need to agree with China are multilateral, not bilateral. It would have to be an issue-by -issue divergence, which is usually solvable diplomatically.""

Biden pressed over crisis at the southern border in his first White House news conference,25/3/2021,"
The President faced a wide-ranging set of questions from reporters about other pressing issues, including the Senate's filibuster rules, working with Republicans on Capitol Hill and voting rights issues in states. Foreign policy was also a central topic as the President faces a slew of diplomatic hurdles with North Korea, China and Afghanistan. 
But it was the crisis at the southern border that dominated the news conference. His administration has faced scrutiny over the growing number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border and the limited press access to border facilities. 
Biden mostly cast blame on the Trump administration for the situation at the border and deflected claims that unaccompanied children are arriving in the US because he is seen as softer on the issue than former President Donald Trump.
He said the spike -- which his own Homeland Security secretary said is putting the US on track to see the most individuals on the southern border in 20 years -- is not unexpected and due more to weather than anything else. 
""It happens every single, solitary year. There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. It happens every year,"" Biden said. ""By the way, does anybody suggest that there was a 31% increase under Trump because he was a nice guy? And he was doing good things at the border? That's not the reason they're coming.""
""The reason they're coming is that it's the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one. Number two, they're coming because of the circumstances in country,"" he continued. 
Biden added that his administration was working on expanding facilities to accommodate unaccompanied minors, telling reporters, ""We're providing for the space, again, to be able to get these kids out of the Border Patrol facilities, which no child, no one should be in any longer than 72 hours,"" pointing to 5,000 new beds at Fort Bliss in west Texas.
""We're building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that Trump dismantled. It's going to take time,"" Biden said.
Biden faces questions over his support for filibuster
The news conference comes more than two months after Inauguration Day -- which is behind many of Biden's presidential predecessors. Thursday's question-and-answer session was Biden's most extended period of questioning with reporters since becoming president. 
In that time, a debate has swirled in Washington about whether Democrats should get rid of the filibuster, a rule in Congress requires a 60-vote threshold to end debate on legislation. Democrats are increasingly in favor of getting rid of the rule in order to advance Biden's agenda, while Republicans like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have warned that would lead to a ""completely scorched-earth Senate.""
The President continued to express openness to filibuster revisions on Thursday, but declined to say whether he supported eliminating the 60-vote threshold.
""We're ready to get a lot done. And if we have to, if there's complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we'll have to go beyond what I'm talking about,"" Biden said, an indication he could go further than changing the rules around the filibuster.
""I believe we should go back to a position of the filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago,"" Biden said, a joke about his age that largely fell flat.
He pulled a card out with statistics, noting that from 1917 until 1971, there were a total of 58 motions to break a filibuster, with ""five times that many"" last year, indicating, he said, that ""it's being abused in a gigantic way.""
Biden suggested he ""strongly"" supports moving back to the original process of the filibuster, but said he also has an ""open mind"" on the use of the filibuster on certain topics, including voting rights, a key legislative priority for him that does not currently have the votes to pass.
""I strongly support moving in that direction, in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are, are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy, like the right to vote, like the basic right to vote,"" he said.
Biden touts vaccination progress and sets a new goal
During the news conference, Biden highlighted surpassing his initial goal of getting 100 million coronavirus vaccine doses in arms in his first 100 days in office. He also announced a new vaccine goal: 200 million doses in arms in his first 100 days, something his administration is already on pace to do.
""I know it's ambitious -- twice our original goal -- but no other country in the world has even come close, not even close to what we're doing. I believe we can do it,"" Biden said. 
On school reopening, Biden cited a report out this week from the Department of Education that shows nearly half of K-8 schools are open, a step toward his goal of getting a majority of K-8 schools fully open in the first 100 days.
""Not yet a majority, but we're really close, and I believe in the 35 days left to go we'll meet that goal as well,"" he said.
He also noted that more than 100 million $1,400 economic impact payments have landed in Americans' bank accounts as a result of the $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. Approximately 127 million stimulus payments worth around $325 billion have been sent to Americans under the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration announced Wednesday.
Biden also said he saw hope for the economy, noting that ""a majority of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projection on the economic growth that's going to take place this year"" to over 6% GDP growth. He also pointed to Thursday's unemployment numbers. Claims fell by nearly 100,000, Biden said, ""the first time in a year the number has fallen below the pre-pandemic high.""
Biden lays out goals with China
The President also previewed a prospective meeting with allies to discuss their relationships with China and discussed what he's said to Chinese President Xi Jinping since taking office.
""Before too long ... I'm going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. And so, we're gonna make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules,"" Biden said.
He also told reporters the US is going to ""reestablish our alliances. And I've been very clear with him -- it's not the anti-Chinese."" 
Xi and Biden were on the phone for two hours during Xi's congratulatory call after Inauguration Day, the President said. 
""We made several things clear to one another. I made it clear to him again ... that we're not looking for confrontation. Although we know there will be steep, steep competition. Two: that we will have strong competition but will insist that China play by the international rules. Thirdly, in order to compete effectively, I indicated that we're going to deal with China effectively, and we're gonna need three things to do that. I tell him, 'Our people first.' We're gonna invest in American workers and American science,"" Biden said. 
The President also said he confronted Xi on China's human rights abuses. 
""The moment a president walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we began to lose our legitimacy around the world,"" Biden said.
Biden: It will be 'hard' to meet deadline for withdrawing troops from Afghanistan
Biden said it will be difficult for the US to meet a May 1 deadline for withdrawing troops from Afghanistan.
""It's going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline,"" he said.
Biden said his administration was consulting with NATO allies and the Afghan government about a withdrawal plan, and said that it was not his ""intention"" to remain in Afghanistan for a long time.
""We are not staying for a long time,"" he said. ""We will leave. The question is when we leave.""
Asked if US troops would be in Afghanistan next year, Biden said, ""I can't picture that being the case.""
CNN has previously reported that the Biden administration is considering a six-month extension for American troops in Afghanistan.
The decision to withdraw by May 1 has found Biden weighing competing instincts: to wind down the 20-year war in Afghanistan, a position he's held for more than a decade, or to remain in the hopes of avoiding a Taliban takeover.
Most officials and those involved in US policy toward Afghanistan believe it unlikely that Biden will order all troops out of the country by the May 1 deadline established in a peace deal the previous administration struck with the Taliban.
Among those advocating against a withdrawal, Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has been the most ardent, suggesting that pulling American troops from Afghanistan now could cause the government in Kabul to collapse and prompt backsliding in women's rights, according to people familiar with the conversations. Milley has argued his case in very strong terms during some meetings of top-level national security officials.
This story has been updated with further developments Thursday.
","President Joe Biden spent much of his first presidential news conference on Thursday facing questions about the crisis on the southern border, promising conditions for unaccompanied minors arriving in the US will improve and blaming the prior administration and the cooler weather for the spike of migrants at the border. The President faced a wide-ranging set of questions from reporters about other pressing issues, including the Senate's filibuster rules, working with Republicans on Capitol Hill and voting rights issues in states. Foreign policy was also a central topic as the President faces a slew of diplomatic hurdles with North Korea, China and Afghanistan.  But it was the crisis at the southern border that dominated the news conference. His administration has faced scrutiny over the growing number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border and the limited press access to border facilities.  Biden mostly cast blame on the Trump administration for the situation at the border and deflected claims that unaccompanied children are arriving in the US because he is seen as softer on the issue than former President Donald Trump. He said the spike -- which his own Homeland Security secretary said is putting the US on track to see the most individuals on the southern border in 20 years -- is not unexpected and due more to weather than anything else.  ""It happens every single, solitary year. There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. It happens every year,"" Biden said. ""By the way, does anybody suggest that there was a 31% increase under Trump because he was a nice guy? And he was doing good things at the border? That's not the reason they're coming."" ""The reason they're coming is that it's the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one. Number two, they're coming because of the circumstances in country,"" he continued.  Biden added that his administration was working on expanding facilities to accommodate unaccompanied minors, telling reporters, ""We're providing for the space, again, to be able to get these kids out of the Border Patrol facilities, which no child, no one should be in any longer than 72 hours,"" pointing to 5,000 new beds at Fort Bliss in west Texas. ""We're building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that Trump dismantled. It's going to take time,"" Biden said. Biden faces questions over his support for filibuster The news conference comes more than two months after Inauguration Day -- which is behind many of Biden's presidential predecessors. Thursday's question-and-answer session was Biden's most extended period of questioning with reporters since becoming president.  In that time, a debate has swirled in Washington about whether Democrats should get rid of the filibuster, a rule in Congress requires a 60-vote threshold to end debate on legislation. Democrats are increasingly in favor of getting rid of the rule in order to advance Biden's agenda, while Republicans like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have warned that would lead to a ""completely scorched-earth Senate."" The President continued to express openness to filibuster revisions on Thursday, but declined to say whether he supported eliminating the 60-vote threshold. ""We're ready to get a lot done. And if we have to, if there's complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we'll have to go beyond what I'm talking about,"" Biden said, an indication he could go further than changing the rules around the filibuster. ""I believe we should go back to a position of the filibuster that existed just when I came to the United States Senate 120 years ago,"" Biden said, a joke about his age that largely fell flat. He pulled a card out with statistics, noting that from 1917 until 1971, there were a total of 58 motions to break a filibuster, with ""five times that many"" last year, indicating, he said, that ""it's being abused in a gigantic way."" Biden suggested he ""strongly"" supports moving back to the original process of the filibuster, but said he also has an ""open mind"" on the use of the filibuster on certain topics, including voting rights, a key legislative priority for him that does not currently have the votes to pass. ""I strongly support moving in that direction, in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are, are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy, like the right to vote, like the basic right to vote,"" he said. Biden touts vaccination progress and sets a new goal During the news conference, Biden highlighted surpassing his initial goal of getting 100 million coronavirus vaccine doses in arms in his first 100 days in office. He also announced a new vaccine goal: 200 million doses in arms in his first 100 days, something his administration is already on pace to do. ""I know it's ambitious -- twice our original goal -- but no other country in the world has even come close, not even close to what we're doing. I believe we can do it,"" Biden said.  On school reopening, Biden cited a report out this week from the Department of Education that shows nearly half of K-8 schools are open, a step toward his goal of getting a majority of K-8 schools fully open in the first 100 days. ""Not yet a majority, but we're really close, and I believe in the 35 days left to go we'll meet that goal as well,"" he said. He also noted that more than 100 million $1,400 economic impact payments have landed in Americans' bank accounts as a result of the $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. Approximately 127 million stimulus payments worth around $325 billion have been sent to Americans under the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration announced Wednesday. Biden also said he saw hope for the economy, noting that ""a majority of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projection on the economic growth that's going to take place this year"" to over 6% GDP growth. He also pointed to Thursday's unemployment numbers. Claims fell by nearly 100,000, Biden said, ""the first time in a year the number has fallen below the pre-pandemic high."" Biden lays out goals with China The President also previewed a prospective meeting with allies to discuss their relationships with China and discussed what he's said to Chinese President Xi Jinping since taking office. ""Before too long ... I'm going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. And so, we're gonna make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold China accountable to follow the rules,"" Biden said. He also told reporters the US is going to ""reestablish our alliances. And I've been very clear with him -- it's not the anti-Chinese.""  Xi and Biden were on the phone for two hours during Xi's congratulatory call after Inauguration Day, the President said.  ""We made several things clear to one another. I made it clear to him again ... that we're not looking for confrontation. Although we know there will be steep, steep competition. Two: that we will have strong competition but will insist that China play by the international rules. Thirdly, in order to compete effectively, I indicated that we're going to deal with China effectively, and we're gonna need three things to do that. I tell him, 'Our people first.' We're gonna invest in American workers and American science,"" Biden said.  The President also said he confronted Xi on China's human rights abuses.  ""The moment a president walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we began to lose our legitimacy around the world,"" Biden said. Biden: It will be 'hard' to meet deadline for withdrawing troops from Afghanistan Biden said it will be difficult for the US to meet a May 1 deadline for withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. ""It's going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline,"" he said. Biden said his administration was consulting with NATO allies and the Afghan government about a withdrawal plan, and said that it was not his ""intention"" to remain in Afghanistan for a long time. ""We are not staying for a long time,"" he said. ""We will leave. The question is when we leave."" Asked if US troops would be in Afghanistan next year, Biden said, ""I can't picture that being the case."" CNN has previously reported that the Biden administration is considering a six-month extension for American troops in Afghanistan.

Traveling to China during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go,25/3/2021,,"If you're planning a trip to China, here's what you'll need to know and expect if you want to visit during the global coronavirus pandemic. The basics The Covid-19 pandemic started in China's Wuhan province, but early and strict lockdowns means the country has got it under control. However, most visitors are not yet allowed entry. What's on offer This is of course one of the world's greatest ancient civilizations. China brought us papermaking, printing, and, of course, tea. Its many dynasties have left their marks in world-famous heritage sites, such as the Great Wall, the Terracotta Warriors of Xian, and ancient towns such as Lijiang. But it's also thoroughly modern, with mushrooming cities and skyscrapers pricking the clouds.  Who can go China closed its borders to nearly all travelers in March 2020, when the pandemic started spreading throughout Europe. On March 15, 2021, restrictions were eased for a select number of travelers from 23 countries. Those coming for work or for humanitarian reasons -- such as reuniting with family -- can apply for visas, as can holders of the APEC Business Travel Card. Residents may also return. All categories, however, must have been vaccinated with Chinese-made vaccines at least 15 days earlier. China already has a Fast Lane agreement with Singapore, allowing business travelers. Business travelers from South Korea are also allowed in. The vaccine news has given hope that at some point in the future, borders might reopen to vaccinated tourists, too. China's foreign ministry says the move is about kickstarting international travel in an ""orderly fashion.""  What are the restrictions? All travelers must present two negative tests -- PCR and antibody tests -- taken within 48 hours of travel.  For the newly qualified entrants, entry depends on having received two doses of Chinese-made Covid-19 vaccines at least 14 days prior to entry. They must apply for  a visa in advance, and show their proof of vaccination on arrival, as well as the negative tests. Arrivals are screened once more at the airport. Those failing the checks will be sent to government facilities. You must then quarantine on arrival. Some regions demand 14 days; others, 21. This might take place at a government facility or at your home. What's the Covid situation? China has reported just over 90,000 cases and 4,636 deaths as of March 23, 2021.  What can visitors expect? Life is largely back to normal, but things can change fast in China -- regional lockdowns have been imposed every time there are new outbreaks of the virus, most recently in an area near Beiijng. The capital was placed on partial lockdown in January.  Lunar New Year celebrations were held mainly online in 2021.

US conducted more than two dozen cyber operations targeting foreign threats to the 2020 election,25/3/2021,"Testifying to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Nakasone, who also heads the National Security Agency, characterized the operations as part of Cyber Command's move towards ""persistent engagement"" from ""being a static to an active force"" in the wake of foreign interference in the 2016 elections. Nakasone did not disclose any specifics about the operations.
A US official had previously confirmed to CNN in November that Cyber Command had conducted missions targeting major adversaries including Russia, Iran and China, but the number of such operations ahead of the election was not previously known. The same official also told CNN that such operations would continue after ballots were cast.
The ""hunt forward"" operations to combat 2020 election interference built on an effort that began in 2018 to identify foreign hackers and tactics. Nakasone called 2018 ""a watershed year"" for Cyber Command as they looked to avoid ""what we'd experienced two years previously"" in terms of foreign election interference.
A major report issued by the US intelligence community last week confirmed that Russia again attempted to interfere in the 2020 US election, specifically ""supporting"" former President Donald Trump and ""denigrating"" President Joe Biden, as well as attempting to undermine confidence in the democratic process. The report also identified Iran as another adversary that engaged in similar activity,
However, the report concluded that the voting systems themselves, ""including voter registration, casting ballots, vote tabulation, or reporting results,"" had not been targeted by US adversaries.
Despite the efforts of Cyber Command and other US government agencies, the report also detailed how some of the same offenders in 2016 also meddled in 2020, including Konstantin Kilimnik, described in the report as a Russian influence agent, and a Russian troll farm also mentioned in the findings.
Biden's Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines has called foreign malign influence an ""enduring challenge facing our country.""
""These efforts by US adversaries seek to exacerbate divisions and undermine confidence in our democratic institutions. Addressing this ongoing challenge requires a whole-of-government approach grounded in an accurate understanding of the problem, which the intelligence community, through assessments such as this one, endeavors to provide,"" she said in a statement last week.
The Biden administration is expected to issue sanctions over the issue of election interference soon, three State Department officials previously told CNN. The sanctions are expected to target multiple countries, including Russia, China and Iran.

Biden has left Trump's China tariffs in place. Here's why,25/3/2021,"President Joe Biden disagreed with Trump's approach to US-China relations, but an immediate thawing of trade restrictions is unlikely after the first face-to-face meeting between US and Chinese officials grew heated, sparking an unusually public exchange of diplomatic barbs.
""China is simultaneously a rival, a trade partner, and an outsized player whose cooperation we'll also need to address certain global challenges,"" Katherine Tai, now Biden's US trade representative, said at her Senate confirmation hearing. 
Taking a hard line on China has support from both Republicans and Democrats, who acknowledge that China engages in unfair trade practices that need to be addressed. A bipartisan group of senators is pushing to pass legislation as soon as next month to try to rein in China's economic influence.
Here's the status of the China tariffs:
The US still has tariffs on 66% of Chinese exports
There is currently a tariff on the majority of the goods being shipped from China into the United States. The average rate is 19% -- more than six times higher than before the trade war began in 2018, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. American importers pay those duties. 
The taxes have raised the price for items such as baseball hats, luggage, bicycles, TVs, sneakers and a variety of materials used by American manufacturers.
China has put tariffs on American-made goods, too. About 58% of US exports to China are affected, with an average rate of 21%. That means Chinese buyers have an incentive to buy certain items from other countries where they might be cheaper without the cost of the tariff. 
Tariffs have cost Americans billions
The tariffs on Chinese-made goods have cost American importers more than $82 billion so far, according to US Customs and Border Protection. 
A report from Moody's Analytics found that the tariffs cost 300,000 jobs and 0.3 percentage points in US GDP during the first year they were in effect. Trump's constant threats to put more tariffs on or escalate the rate of existing duties created an extremely uncertain environment for imports, discouraging business investment. 
Economists also assume that some of that cost is passed on to the consumer. An estimate from JPMorgan Chase found the tariffs cost the average household about $600 a year and a separate study from?researchers at the NY Fed, Princeton, and Columbia University, estimated the cost at just north of $800 per household each year. 
Farmers were hurt, but Trump's aid package helped
China targeted US farmers by hitting agricultural products, like soybeans, wheat and corn, with retaliatory tariffs.
Soybean farmers were hit especially hard. Exports to China, their biggest market, slowed to a trickle during for years. The price for soybeans plummeted and the amount in storage reached record highs.
But the Trump administration sent about $28 billion -- about double the cost of the 2009 auto bailout -- to help farmers stay afloat. 
A 2020 agreement didn't lift tariffs
Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached what they called a Phase One agreement in early 2020. It reduced the rate of some of the tariffs, but left them in place. 
As part of the deal, China pledged to step up its purchases of American-made goods and agricultural products. But China fell more than 40% short of purchasing what it had committed to in 2020, according to Peterson Institute of International Economics. 
Even at the time, experts were skeptical China would be able to meet its pledge to double the amount it bought from US farmers before the trade war started. The pandemic also played a role, slowing trade around the globe. 
Still, farmers were pleased to see China buying more in 2020 that they did the year before -- even if the lofty goal was missed. The deal also includes a 2021 purchase goal. 
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack is optimistic about the progress China has made, telling CNBC recently that ""China seems to be living up to its responsibilities.""
""The bad news is: At any point in time, because of the complex nature of the China-U.S. relationship, things can happen that might affect those purchases,"" he added. 
Addressing intellectual property theft
Trump used tariffs as a negotiating tactic, meant to hurt China's economy and pressure Beijing to agree to a new trade deal that addresses unfair trade practices, such as intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers. That's a goal that business leaders across the country, as well as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle agree on.
Some of those issues were addressed in the Phase One agreement, but things like subsidies and state-owned enterprises were left untouched. 
""China agreed to make some domestic improvements. But how much of that will be enforced is yet to be determined,"" said Chad Bown, a senior research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 
Trade deficit grows
The trade deficit was one of Trump's favorite metrics he used to argue that China was undercutting American businesses. He pledged to narrow the gap between exports and imports but the trade deficit between the United States and all other countries grew from $481 billion to nearly $682 billion during his tenure. 
Still, the goods deficit with China alone narrowed after Trump implemented the tariffs. The trade gap totaled $311 billion in 2020, down from a record high of $419 billion in 2018.

What to watch for at Biden's first presidential news conference,25/3/2021,"The news conference comes more than two months into Biden's presidency, which is behind many of his predecessors. Fifteen of Biden's predecessors held a solo news conference within 33 days of taking office, according to a CNN analysis of the past 100 years. But Biden regularly answers questions from reporters at events at the White House or on its South Lawn. 
Biden is set to formally take questions after signing his first major legislative achievement, a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package, into law. The legislation has funds allocated to help schools reopen safely, for the national vaccination effort and direct economic relief for Americans. 
The briefing also comes as the nation reels from mass shootings in Colorado and Georgia that together killed 18 people in less than a week. Biden has pushed the Senate to pass a pair of House-approved gun control laws expanding background checks and an assault weapon ban. The measures don't currently have enough support to pass -- and the White House hasn't ruled out taking executive action. 
Here's what to watch during Biden's first formal news conference of his presidency:
Covid-19  

More than 544,700 Americans had died from Covid-19 as of Wednesday afternoon, according to Johns Hopkins University. More than 130,400,000 Covid-19 doses have been administered in the US, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The US has a seven-day average of administering about 2.5 million doses per day. A month ago, the seven-day average was about 1.5 million, according to a CNN analysis of CDC data.
The administration surpassed its goal of administering 100 million Covid-19 vaccine shots well within Biden's goal of doing so in his 100 days in office. Biden is expected to announce his new vaccination goal on Thursday. 
If Americans continue to get vaccinated and follow health and safety guidelines, Biden said there is a ""good chance"" that family and friends will be able to celebrate the Fourth of July together in small groups.?The President directed states to make all adults eligible to get Covid-19 vaccines by May 1. 
When and how schools can reopen safely is a national hot-button issue, and many students have been out of classrooms for more than a year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Biden has set a goal of reopening a majority of schools within his first 100 days in office. 
Immigration 

The Biden administration is scrambling to find adequate housing for the rising number of unaccompanied minors arriving at the US-Mexico border. Biden has said that he will travel to the border at some point, and senior administration officials and lawmakers have already made the trip down to see facilities housing the migrants. 
A group of White House officials and members of Congress toured a Texas facility on Wednesday holding unaccompanied migrant children and for the first time under the Biden administration a news camera was allowed inside. 
There are more than 16,000 unaccompanied children in US custody, including around 4,800 in US Customs and Border Protection custody and 11,300 in Department of Health and Human Services custody.
As of Sunday, more than 800 unaccompanied migrant children had been in Border Patrol custody for more than 10 days, according to documents reviewed by CNN. Federal law requires unaccompanied children to be turned over within 72 hours to HHS, which oversees a shelter network designed to house minors, but amid constraints related to the pandemic, children are staying in custody for longer than the 72-hour limit.
Gun reform

Biden has called for a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and has urged the Senate to pass two gun safety bills that have already cleared the House of Representatives. But the chances the Senate passes any gun legislation remain highly unlikely given it would require significant Republican support. 
The White House is weighing whether to issue a number of gun safety measures through executive action. But Vice President Kamala Harris noted Wednesday morning: ""If we really want something that is going to be lasting, we need to pass legislation.""
The mass shooting at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, this week killed 10 people. Less than a week prior, the shootings in Atlanta left eight people dead, including six women of Asian descent. 
The filibuster 

Some Democrats in Congress want to change Senate rules so they can use their slim majority to pass things unlikely to garner Republican support, such as a voting rights bill or the massive infrastructure package that Biden is expected to introduce. Right now they need to garner 60 votes to overcome Republican objection -- or, filibuster -- a tally that requires several Republicans to join Democrats. 
Biden's legislative agenda will be greatly affected by whether the filibuster stays or goes. The President has said he supports changing?the Senate's filibuster rule?by bringing back the talking filibuster, requiring a senator who wants to block legislation to hold the floor without taking a break. 
The Covid-19 relief package was able to pass through Congress because of a special budget process called reconciliation, which Democrats used to advance the legislation in the chamber with only a simple majority and no Republican support. But those rules can't apply to things such as gun control or voting rights because they aren't budget related.
Infrastructure and spending

White House advisers are expected to present a two-part, $3 trillion jobs and infrastructure proposal to Biden as soon as this week, CNN has reported. The proposal, the White House's next major legislative agenda item, would mark a sweeping move toward enacting the key elements of the jobs agenda that Biden laid out in large part during his presidential campaign. 
The proposal, which Biden's top advisers have been deliberating over for weeks, would be segmented into two separate parts -- one focused on infrastructure and clean energy, and a second on what's being termed the ""care economy"" with a focus zeroed in on key domestic economic issues.
The package will explode spending and is also expected to raise taxes on individuals earning more than $400,000 a year, as well as increase the corporate tax rate.
Foreign policy

Biden will take the stage as a series of perennial foreign policy challenges arise, including North Korea testing missiles and a looming decision on when and how to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan. Both are fraught with history and complicated factors to weigh -- particularly in Afghanistan where the US has been mired in war for two decades. Pulling out, however, could cause further damage and decline in a country so much American blood has spilled to democracy build.
The President is also sure to get questions about his team's harsh words with China and his own verbal jousting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Talks with China in Alaska got off to a rocky start and hot tempers, over issues such as trade and cybersecurity. Russia, meanwhile, has been accused of election interference in both the 2016 and 2020 election by top US national security experts.
Biden will surely get asked about how he plans to navigate both adversaries while reestablishing the United States as a world leader on human rights.
","President Joe Biden is holding his first formal news conference on Thursday and will likely face scrutiny over his administration's response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the growing number of unaccompanied migrant children crossing the border and gun control, among many other pressing issues.  The news conference comes more than two months into Biden's presidency, which is behind many of his predecessors. Fifteen of Biden's predecessors held a solo news conference within 33 days of taking office, according to a CNN analysis of the past 100 years.

There are more than 16,000 unaccompanied children in US custody, including around 4,800 in US Customs and Border Protection custody and 11,300 in Department of Health and Human Services custody. As of Sunday, more than 800 unaccompanied migrant children had been in Border Patrol custody for more than 10 days, according to documents reviewed by CNN. Federal law requires unaccompanied children to be turned over within 72 hours to HHS, which oversees a shelter network designed to house minors, but amid constraints related to the pandemic, children are staying in custody for longer than the 72-hour limit. Gun reform Biden has called for a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and has urged the Senate to pass two gun safety bills that have already cleared the House of Representatives. But the chances the Senate passes any gun legislation remain highly unlikely given it would require significant Republican support.  The White House is weighing whether to issue a number of gun safety measures through executive action. But Vice President Kamala Harris noted Wednesday morning: ""If we really want something that is going to be lasting, we need to pass legislation."" The mass shooting at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, this week killed 10 people. Less than a week prior, the shootings in Atlanta left eight people dead, including six women of Asian descent.  The filibuster  Some Democrats in Congress want to change Senate rules so they can use their slim majority to pass things unlikely to garner Republican support, such as a voting rights bill or the massive infrastructure package that Biden is expected to introduce. Right now they need to garner 60 votes to overcome Republican objection -- or, filibuster -- a tally that requires several Republicans to join Democrats.  Biden's legislative agenda will be greatly affected by whether the filibuster stays or goes. The President has said he supports changing?the Senate's filibuster rule?by bringing back the talking filibuster, requiring a senator who wants to block legislation to hold the floor without taking a break.  The Covid-19 relief package was able to pass through Congress because of a special budget process called reconciliation, which Democrats used to advance the legislation in the chamber with only a simple majority and no Republican support. But those rules can't apply to things such as gun control or voting rights because they aren't budget related. Infrastructure and spending White House advisers are expected to present a two-part, $3 trillion jobs and infrastructure proposal to Biden as soon as this week, CNN has reported. The proposal, the White House's next major legislative agenda item, would mark a sweeping move toward enacting the key elements of the jobs agenda that Biden laid out in large part during his presidential campaign.  The proposal, which Biden's top advisers have been deliberating over for weeks, would be segmented into two separate parts -- one focused on infrastructure and clean energy, and a second on what's being termed the ""care economy"" with a focus zeroed in on key domestic economic issues. The package will explode spending and is also expected to raise taxes on individuals earning more than $400,000 a year, as well as increase the corporate tax rate. Foreign policy Biden will take the stage as a series of perennial foreign policy challenges arise, including North Korea testing missiles and a looming decision on when and how to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan. Both are fraught with history and complicated factors to weigh -- particularly in Afghanistan where the US has been mired in war for two decades. Pulling out, however, could cause further damage and decline in a country so much American blood has spilled to democracy build. The President is also sure to get questions about his team's harsh words with China and his own verbal jousting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Talks with China in Alaska got off to a rocky start and hot tempers, over issues such as trade and cybersecurity. Russia, meanwhile, has been accused of election interference in both the 2016 and 2020 election by top US national security experts. Biden will surely get asked about how he plans to navigate both adversaries while reestablishing the United States as a world leader on human rights.",politics,POLITICS
"Beijing's crackdown in Xinjiang has separated thousands of children from their parents, new report claims. CNN found two of them",25/3/2021,"That was five years ago. He says he hasn't seen them since.
Mamutjan's wife Muherrem took their daughter and son from Malaysia back to the region in western China to get a new passport in December 2015. They remain trapped there, he said, caught up in the sweeping government crackdown against Muslim minorities that has reportedly seen up to 2 million people arbitrarily detained in vast camps across Xinjiang. 
China has denied the allegations of human rights abuses in the region, saying the camps are necessary to prevent religious extremism and terrorism.
Mamutjan said his family, who are ethnically Uyghur, are unable to leave China, while he would be at risk of being detained or imprisoned if he returned. He is now living in Adelaide, Australia.
This week, a CNN team tracked down Mamutjan's 10-year-old daughter Muhlise at her paternal grandparents' home in the city of Kashgar, in southern Xinjiang.
When asked if she has a message for her father, whom she hasn't spoken to since 2017, Muhlise began to cry. ""I miss him,"" she said. 
When Mamutjan watched the video from his home in Adelaide, he struggled to fight back his tears.
""I can't believe how tall (my daughter) is now ... What kind of country does this to innocent people?"" he said.
In a new report released Thursday, Amnesty International estimated there may be thousands of Uyghur families like Mamutjan's worldwide, parents and children who have been separated for years as a result of the Chinese government's tightening grip on Xinjiang.
Under the leadership of the country's all-powerful President Xi Jinping, Muslim minorities in Xinjiang have allegedly been subject to a government-engineered program of mass incarceration, forced indoctrination and even sterilization.
According to the Amnesty International report, some parents who fled the region in the early days of the crackdown have been unable to reunite with their children. Others, like Mamutjan, found themselves on opposite sides of the ocean by accident, and now fear returning to Xinjiang.
Alkan Akad, a China researcher at Amnesty International, said the separation of parents and children isn't all accidental. In some cases, it can be a deliberate tactic by authorities.
""The Chinese government wants to gain a leverage over the Uyghur population residing abroad, so that they would be able to stop them from engaging in activism and speaking out for their families and their relatives in Xinjiang,"" said Akad, who authored the new report.
Speaking at a news briefing on March 15, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said accusations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang were ""baseless and sensational.""
""Xinjiang-related issues are not human rights issues at all. They are in essence about countering violent terrorism, radicalization and separatism,"" he said.
The Chinese government has not responded to CNN's detailed questions on any of the families mentioned in the article, or on the scale of the family separations between Uyghurs in Xinjiang and abroad.
'We did not deserve all of this""
The last time that Mamutjan said his family were all together -- him, his wife and their two children -- was in Malaysia in 2015. 
Back then, Mamutjan said he was studying for his doctorate degree in Muslim World Studies, with a full scholarship, while his wife, Muherrem was learning English. He said his daughter Muhlise was in kindergarten and ""very active,"" always running around everywhere, playing in parks and on the university campus. His son was only six months old. 
""We were quite happy. We had no major troubles in life,"" he said.
In December that year, Mamutjan said, his wife went back to Xinjiang with the two children. According to Mamutjan, she had lost her passport and the Chinese embassy in Malaysia had refused to issue her a new one unless she went back to her hometown of Kashgar.
Her passport was renewed in 2016, but Mamutjan said his wife wasn't able to leave immediately due to some financial issues. Then, around the beginning of 2017, her travel documents and those of the children were confiscated by authorities. 
A few months later, he said his wife vanished. ""I was in constant contact with my wife before April 15, 2017. We would chat daily, video chat with the children. And in the middle of April 2017, she promptly disappeared from (Chinese messaging app) WeChat,"" he said.
""I called home the following day and my mom told me that she was gone for a short period of time, for a short study course ... And I realized that she was detained.""
Mamutjan said he hasn't spoken to his wife since. Initially he was worried his children might have been sent to state-run orphanages, but later received social media videos showing them still living separately with their grandparents from each side.
Worried for his safety, Mamutjan said he left Malaysia and moved to Australia. There was no word from his family for years -- Uyghurs in Xinjiang can be placed in detention for only minor perceived infractions, including for contacting relatives abroad, according to leaked records seen by CNN, and it is common for families still in Xinjiang to cut communications.
Then in May 2019, Mamutjan said, he saw a social media video of his son, then age 4, excitedly shouting, ""My mom has graduated!"" The Chinese government insists the internment camps are ""vocational training centers"" and detainees are ""students,"" and Mamutjan took his son's joyful cheering to mean his wife had been released. 
Mamutjan said he called his parents, hoping the video was a sign the family's situation had improved, but when his mother answered, she told him there were Chinese Communist Party officials in the house and hung up.
With Mamutjan's permission, CNN journalists visited his parents' house in Kashgar unannounced to see if they could help locate his children -- and find out what happened to his wife.
His daughter Muhlise answered the door in a bright pink shirt and black pants. When showed a picture of Mamutjan, she said: ""This is my Dad."" She said she knew where her father was but seemed unwilling to talk about her mother's location. 
After checking the answer with her grandparents, Muhlise said her mother was at her other grandmother's house but she ""can't see her very often."" The 10-year-old said she last saw her mother ""a month or two ago."" She said her brother was not with her but she saw him regularly.
CNN has asked the Chinese authorities about the mother's whereabouts, but has not received a reply. CNN also tried to visit the maternal grandparents' home in Kashgar, but the team couldn't find anyone there -- the door was bolted from the outside.
When Muhlise was asked if she wanted to be reunited with her father, she said, ""We can't go ... Our passports were confiscated.""
After keeping her composure throughout the arrival of the CNN team, Muhlise began to break down when asked if she missed her father. ""I don't have my mom here, and I don't have my dad here either ... I want to be reunited with them,"" she said. Hearing the question, her grandmother burst into tears.
Mamutjan said he believed the Chinese government was separating parents from their children as a way to intimidate and control Xinjiang's minority groups.
""It's basically a collective punishment for their ethnicity and religion and their unique cultural values,"" he said. ""We did not deserve all of this immense suffering.""
Desperate measures
Some parents have resorted to desperate measures to try and be reunited with their children.
In 2016, Ablikim Mamtinin and his wife Mihriban Kader said they were forced to flee Xinjiang after she became pregnant with their sixth child. Under China's family planning policies, most families were only allowed to have one child until 2015, although rural ethnic minorities, including the Uyghurs, were permitted up to three in the region. A new policy implemented in 2017 said all urban couples in Xinjiang could have two children, while rural couples could have three.
With each new child, Mihriban and Ablikim said they had been paying fines and bribes to avoid punishments from the authorities. But in 2016, they said they were given a warning from local officials that their patience was at an end.
Ablikim said if they had stayed in Xinjiang any longer, his wife would have been forced to have an abortion. ""They would have imprisoned me for having six children,"" he said.
Mihriban and Ablikim managed to get tourist visas to Italy, giving them a chance to escape and start a new life in Europe. But their travel agent said they weren't able to get visas for all five of their children -- only the youngest. Zumeryem, Yehya, Muhammad and Shehide would have to stay behind.
It was a heartbreaking choice for Mihriban and Ablikim. In the end, after leaving the four children with their grandparents, they left, hoping to be reunited as soon as possible once they were settled in Italy. But as the crackdown intensified in Xinjiang, their relatives in China stopped responding to their calls and emails. The parents heard some of their relatives were detained, which they believed was a result of their decision to leave for Italy. Soon it became impossible to contact anyone -- and they were unable to reach or learn the whereabouts of their four older children for almost four years.
When they finally reconnected in early 2020, and the parents heard how desperate the situation had become inside Xinjiang, they decided it was time to urgently take their children out of China. Visa clearance documents for the four siblings had been approved by the Italian government in 2019, but their passports were about to expire, and the parents say the authorities had been threatening to send the children to a state-owned orphanage.
In June 2020, directed remotely by their parents in Italy and a cousin in Canada, the four siblings -- then aged between 11 and 16 -- traveled from their remote village in Xinjiang all the way to Shanghai, a journey of more than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers), in an attempt to get their visas to rejoin their parents in Italy.
The four children took little money and no baggage to avoid suspicion from authorities along the way. But when they went to the Italian consulate in Shanghai to pick up their visas, the children said they were blocked by a Chinese security guard in the lobby of the building, where the consulate sits on the 19th floor. 
Emails from consulate officials then directed the children to a different Italian visa office in Shanghai, which eventually rejected their visa application, saying they couldn't recognize the visa clearance documents, and minors needed to be accompanied by adults. They also said the four should apply in Beijing, which was under a Covid-19 lockdown at the time.
The Italian visa office and the Italian consulate in Shanghai have not responded to CNN's inquiries. The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Rome told CNN ""we won't comment"" on the case.
Eventually the cousin lost contact with the four siblings as two of them were making their way back to their hotel. Later, the parents say they were told by their children that they had been taken by officials and brought back to Xinjiang, where they were interrogated and then sent to a Covid-19 quarantine center for two weeks.
When they were released, the four children were put into a state-sponsored orphanage.
In the county seat of Payzawat, about an hour's drive from Kashgar, CNN attempted to locate the four  siblings with their parents' permission, but local officials did not allow the team to visit the children. CNN was able to connect with Yehya, the second-oldest child, over a WeChat video call, as what he called a ""teacher"" off camera prompted the young man with what to say to journalists.
When asked if he wanted to be reunited with his parents, he said, ""I do.""
At one point, a voice on the other end of the phone told Yehya, ""Tell them that you see your sister every day."" When asked if he wanted to pass on any messages to his parents, the voice told him to say that he had ""nothing"" to say to his parents.  
Since their failed escape attempt, when the children occasionally gain access to a phone in the orphanage, they can speak to their parents. Recently, the children sent a photograph of the four of them standing in front of barbed wire outside the facility. Another image they sent showed the siblings with a sign in Chinese, saying, ""Dad, Mom, we miss you.""
Despite the difficulties they face in retrieving their children, Mihriban and Ablikim said they aren't going to stop trying.
Now living in the small Italian town of Priverno, near Rome, the couple encourage their three youngest children to kiss the photos of their older siblings every day. 
""I will never give up until I bring back my children safely and rejoin with my family,"" Mihriban said.
 
'I only want to bring my children back'
In a report released in March, more than 50 global experts in international law and Xinjiang named China's removal of children from Uyghur families as a violation of the UN Genocide Convention.
Under the convention, ""forcibly transferring children of (an ethnic) group to another group"" is considered as an act of genocide, if it is intended to destroy the protected group. The experts found that was in the case in Xinjiang. 
The March report quoted a Chinese government document that showed, between 2017 and 2019, the number of children who had been separated from their families in Xinjiang and placed into state-run boarding schools had increased by 76.9%, from just under 500,000 to 880,500.
During a news conference in Beijing on March 7, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi denied there was any evidence of genocide occurring in Xinjiang, calling the allegations ""preposterous."" 
Uyghur historian Rian Thum, a senior lecturer at the University of Manchester and co-author on the March report, said the placement of children in state-run orphanages is part of a Chinese government strategy to try to assimilate the Uyghur population.
""This is a consistent widespread policy, they have special terminology for it,"" Thum said. ""We see it not just in one area or two, we can see it across the entirety of the Uyghur region."" 
The Chinese government has denied attempting to erase Uyghur culture, saying it respects all of China's ethnic minorities and religions. At a news conference in February, a spokesman for the Xinjiang government said there were a variety of reasons why Uyghurs overseas might have lost touch with their relatives back home, including that they may be ""criminal suspects in police custody.""
""If you cannot get in touch with your relatives in Xinjiang, you should contact the nearest Chinese embassy or consulate. We will work with them to provide assistance,"" he said.
But CNN's interviews with both sets of children illustrated the tight security and immense pressure under which many Uyghurs in Xinjiang -- both old and young -- live every day.
In his video call with CNN, Mihriban and Ablikim's son Yehya often repeated verbatim answers from the ""teacher"" next to him, glanced around nervously and looked off the camera.
Even when interviewed in their own home, Uyghurs appeared to watch their words. When Mamutjan's daughter Muhlise was asked during CNN's unannounced visit whether her mother had been sent to a ""vocational training center,"" she whispered to her paternal grandparents who told her in Uyghur to ""say nothing like that."" ""Say she is at home,"" her grandfather said.
The interview was cut short when the family said local authorities came around looking for them.
Mamutjan said he was worried not just about his own son and daughter but a whole generation of Uyghur children who had grown up under the crackdown in Xinjiang.
""The Uyghur children in the orphanages ... are being brainwashed, (they) would be clueless about their culture, about their language, and their religious values,"" he said.
For the four Ablikim siblings, their father is making a last-ditch, direct appeal to China's leader Xi Jinping, who has recently called his government's Xinjiang policy ""completely correct,"" to allow the children to fly to Italy and reunite with their parents.
""President of China,"" Ablikim said. ""I only want you to bring my children back.""
","It was supposed to be a routine trip home to Xinjiang for Mamutjan Abdurehim's wife and two children. That was five years ago. He says he hasn't seen them since. Mamutjan's wife Muherrem took their daughter and son from Malaysia back to the region in western China to get a new passport in December 2015.

Traveling to Disney Parks during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go,25/3/2021,,"If you're planning to travel to one of the Disney Parks & Resorts around the world, here's what you'll need to know and expect if you want to visit during the Covid-19 pandemic.   The basics After being closed for more than a year, Disneyland Resort in California plans to reopen on April 30 with limited capacity at Disneyland park and Disney California Adventure park. Only California residents may visit the parks until further notice.
Those wanting to visit will need to purchase tickets in advence via a new reservation system.
Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa is set to reopen on April 29 but the Disneyland Hotel and Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel remain closed. No reopening date has been set. In Florida, most of Disney World's parks are open. The Blizzard Beach water park reopened on March 7. No reopening date has been set for Typhoon Lagoon, however.   Hong Kong Disneyland reopened in February -- the third reopening for the park since the start of the pandemic. Disneyland Paris was slated to reopen on April 2. However, the park announced it is once again postponing its reopening. No new date has been announced. If you have a booking, you may modify your arrival date or cancel your reservation without fees. The park hasn't yet announced a new tentative opening.   Though Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea are open, a visitor cap is reportedly in place until at least March 21, with each park allowing 5,000 visitors per day, excluding those who have already bought advance tickets.   What's on offer The original and, some might say, best, theme parks, Disney's resorts remain a magical experience for all the family. From vertiginous rides to firework displays, and of course the chance to meet classic characters, a trip to a Disney Park makes memories that last a lifetime. Who can go Entry to each Disney Park is dependent on local travel restrictions. That means locations in the United States are only open to foreign visitors from outside the European Schengen Area, UK, Ireland, China, Iran and Brazil, while its Paris location -- when it reopens -- will be subject to France's entry rules, which prevent most non-EU nationals from coming into the country.  Only locals and returning citizens can access its Tokyo and Hong Kong parks, while its Shanghai resort can only be accessed by locals or those who meet China's strict entry requirements, including two negative test results taken within 48 hours of departures. When it reopens, Disneyland Resort will only be open to California residents until further notice. All guests will need to obtain an advance reservation for entry through a new reservations system coming soon. What are the restrictions? All Disney Parks require guests to wear masks, and some parks' mask requirements are more stringent than others. For instance, Walt Disney World, Florida, mandates face coverings for everyone 2 or older, including people who have been vaccinated.  Every park has reduced capacity, and guests must take a temperature check on entry and observe social distancing at all times.  What's the Covid situation? Exact numbers of cases linked to Disney Parks are unclear. What can visitors expect? Disney World, Florida, canceled its parade and fireworks indefinitely in a bid to keep guests safely apart.  Older interactive games, such as the hands-on scavenger hunt game Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom, have been closed. Capacity has also been cut, with numbers further limited in restaurants and in queues to prevent overcrowding. Despite this, guests can still dine in at their favorite restaurants and enjoy the rides, though character meet-and-greets have been replaced by socially distanced character processions. Useful links Official Disney Parks site Our latest coverage On October 1, 1971, Florida's Walt Disney World first opened its gates.  To mark the milestone, Walt Disney World Resort says it's launching ""The World's Most Magical Celebration"" starting October 1, 2021. And the party will last for 18 months. Repeat visits to Disneyland and Disney's California Adventure haven't been possible since the theme parks closed at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. And now, the parks' annual pass program is officially coming to an end. Disney Parks announced January 13 that it will cancel annual passes and replace them with a new program. Meanwhile, also in the US, Disneyland's Jungle Cruise is getting a 21st century makeover after years of criticism. And officials announced that Disneyland Resort in Anaheim will soon be the first ""super"" Covid-19 vaccination site in Orange County, California. Walt Disney World reopened in July, but it hasn't all been good news in the Disney world -- the company has laid off 28,000 employees in the US because of the pandemic, and profits from its parks in China might drop by $280 million.

1. Boulder shooting?
Tributes are pouring in and vigils being planned after Monday's shooting in Boulder, Colorado. People lined the streets yesterday as the body of?Officer Eric Talley, one of 10 victims, was taken to a funeral home in nearby Aurora. The 21-year-old gunman is expected to make his first court appearance today and is facing 10 first-degree murder charges and one charge of attempted murder. In response to the shooting, President Biden is pushing a set of House-passed gun control reforms, including a universal background checks measure and an assault weapons ban. A federal appeals court also ruled yesterday that states may restrict the open carrying of guns in public. That ruling will likely be appealed to a Supreme Court hostile to Second Amendment limits. Meanwhile, the gun industry is preparing for a sales surge -- a phenomenon that plays out whenever gun rights debates heat up.

2. White House
Biden will hold his first formal White House news conference today since taking office two months ago, and he'll face tough questions about issues like gun control and immigration. He's also expected to highlight blasting through his goal of 100 million coronavirus vaccine doses given in his first 100 days and passage of his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue bill. He may also shed light on his foreign policy positions regarding the country's tricky relationships with Russia and China. Biden has waited to hold his first official news conference longer than his 15 most recent predecessors, so reporters -- and the American public -- are eager to hear from him. The event is set for 1:15 p.m. ET.

3. Coronavirus
Some Democratic lawmakers have asked the President to issue a ""waiver of informed consent"" to make Covid-19 vaccines mandatory for all US military service members. Meanwhile, 27 million vaccine doses will be distributed across the US this week, according to the White House, but advocates for the elderly are worried the administration isn't doing enough to get vaccines to senior citizens. As of Tuesday, CDC records show more than 43% of Americans age 65 and older are fully vaccinated against Covid-19; that still leaves more than half the older population vulnerable. In Brazil, it's actually young people who are now getting severely ill and dying of the virus. Brazil is in its worst days of the pandemic, with hospitals near collapse and daily death tolls reaching record numbers.

4. Immigration
Biden has tasked Vice President Kamala Harris with overseeing diplomatic efforts with Central American countries to stem the flow of migrants to the US southern border. And with a steep number of unaccompanied minors in US custody, some former Border Patrol chiefs are imploring leaders in Congress for more resources and to take steps to reform the US immigration system. Not only has the Biden administration been under mounting pressure to fix the crisis,?it's also been called out for not giving journalists access inside facilities housing migrant children. Legislators yesterday toured one such facility in Texas -- with a news camera finally in tow.?

5. Suez Canal
A container ship ran aground Tuesday in the Suez canal, blocking one of the world's busiest waterways and stranding dozens of vessels on both sides in one of the worst shipping jams seen in years. And ... it's still there. In fact, the CEO of a salvage company says it may take days or weeks to free the massive tanker from the comparatively tiny waterway. The 224,000-ton vessel is almost as long as the Empire State Building is tall and got stuck because of a sandstorm and bad navigation. Shipping experts say if it's not cleared soon, some vessels may have to be rerouted around the southern tip of Africa, adding about a week to their journeys. Just how important is this narrow waterway? Roughly 30% of the world's shipping container volume transits through its 120 miles every day. Well, most days. Not today.

The Olympic flame starts its final leg to Tokyo. Some suggest this day should never have come,25/3/2021,"But the Grand Start of the Olympic Torch Relay in Fukushima was closed to the public on Thursday, as members of Japan's women's football team prepared to kick off the flame's 121-day domestic journey to Tokyo.
Amid the pandemic, anyone not among the 300 invited participants and officials could only watch a livestream of the event at Fukushima's J-Village National Training Center.
In 2011, the site was used as an operational base for relief efforts following the massive earthquake and tsunami that triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on March 11 that year. Tokyo 2020 organizers chose Fukushima as the torch relay's starting point to highlight the region's recovery from the triple disaster. From there, 10,000 runners will carry the torch through Japan's 47 prefectures in a show of national unity.

But in recent weeks, the positive narrative has stalled. Some Fukushima residents argue the region has far from recovered. Several celebrity torchbearers, who were expected to attract large crowds along the relay's route, have pulled out of the event, citing concerns over Covid-19. 
In February, the western Shimane prefecture even threatened to cancel torch relay events if coronavirus cases didn't fall, according to local media reports, which said a decision would be made in April.
Last week, Olympic organizers said the postponed 2020 Tokyo Games, now scheduled for July 23 to August 8, would go ahead without any overseas spectators. The Paralympics, from August 24 to September 5, would also not be welcoming traveling fans, they said.
With costs and logistical challenges mounting amid the pandemic, public support for the blockbuster sporting event has fallen to an all-time low in Japan. Earlier this year, a poll by public broadcaster NHK showed 77% of those surveyed want the Tokyo Games either canceled or postponed further.
As the pandemic continues to roil the world and organizers grapple with the complexities of holding the mega sporting event later than planned, many are asking if the Olympics have lost their luster.

Tarnished spectacle
At its core, the modern Olympics -- first held in Athens in 1896 -- symbolize peace, harmony and solidarity between nations, according to organizers, the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
But it would be hard to find an example of an Olympic Games free from political, economic or cultural scandal, according to Lee Jung-woo, an expert on sports diplomacy and international relations at the University of Edinburgh.
Lee cites as examples the Nazi propaganda-tarnished 1936 Berlin Olympics, and Mexico City in 1968, when the Games followed a military massacre of unarmed civilians protesting against the event being held there. 

He also highlighted Montreal, where taxpayers took three decades to pay off the debts for hosting the 1976 Summer Games.
Pandemic problems aside, Tokyo 2020 has also been hit by scandals, including an allegedly plagiarized Olympic logo to the resignation of the organizing committee president over sexist comments about women.
Another issue is that former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe -- who resigned in August -- initially intended to use the Olympics as a platform to build his reelection campaign, tainting the public perception of the Games from the start, according to Simon Chadwick, director of Eurasian Sport at Emlyon Business School in France.  
""I don't think there was ever any popular consensus or agreement across Japan that the country needed to host the Olympic Games,""' he said.

In Fukushima, feelings toward the Olympics are mixed. 
The relay is a moment of personal triumph for Takayuki Ueno, 46, a torchbearer from Minamisoma city whose 8-year-old daughter, 3-year-old son, and parents died in the 2011 tsunami. ""I am going to run with a smile, so that my parents and children that I lost won't worry about me,"" he said.
High school student, Ryoji Sakuma, was only able to return to Katsurao village three years ago when evacuation orders lifted. The 16-year-old torchbearer  helps out on his family's dairy farm and said he wanted to show the world how much Fukushima had recovered, and that, despite rumors, its produce is safe to eat. 

But Saki Ookawara, spokeswoman for an organization that advocates for evacuees displaced by the nuclear meltdown, said the government is using the Olympics as a political tool to show Japan has overcome repercussions of the triple disaster, when that is not strictly the case.
Although many communities have rebuilt, there are as many as 35,703 nuclear evacuees still unable to return to their homes in Fukushima prefecture as of this month, according to the local government. ""I don't understand why Japan is hosting an Olympics when the nuclear disaster has not been fully resolved,"" said Ookawara.
Spotlight on Japan
The entire symbolism of the Olympics and torch relay has changed amid the pandemic, according to Barbara Holthus, deputy director of the German Institute for Japanese Studies.
""The original idea for Tokyo was to show the world how cool Japan is -- it was an opportunity for the country to reimagine itself and to come together as one. Forty million visitors were expected to visit Japan in 2020 to give the country an economic boost -- but none of that is happening. The Olympics are failing in all instances,"" said Holthus.

The Tokyo 2020 Olympics are already the most expensive Summer Games ever, with the one-year postponement of the event pushing the cost up at least $15 billion to total $25 billion, according to Japanese media reports.
Pulling off the world's most complex sporting event, involving more than 11,000 athletes from over 200 countries who must be kept safe, will also be no easy feat.
Organizers are now racing to determine how Tokyo can stage the event safely, especially considering the capital only lifted its third state of emergency on Monday following a third wave of infections.
Authorities must figure out how to protect not only athletes, but also citizens of the world's most populous metropolitan area, a daunting task considering Japan's huge elderly population and its slower-than-expected rollout of coronavirus vaccines.
Ayako Kajiwara, a nurse who works in a hospital near Tokyo, said she hoped vaccinations would be sped up in the country to better protect the population. ""Some people in Japan think the Games should be canceled (but) others have already bought tickets for events,"" she said.
""For me, the Olympics represents the idea of the world coming together and I'd like to have some hope. I worry what will happen if it doesn't go ahead as the taxpayers might bear the burden,"" she added.
As Tokyo 2020 will be the first mega sporting event held during the pandemic, the health and safety measures implemented -- whether successful or not -- could serve as useful markers for future international sporting competitions. 
""In that sense, Tokyo's anti-coronavirus programme would be marked as a long-lasting legacy of this Olympic Games,"" said Lee.
Olympic legacy
The most successful Games are those designed to leave behind a positive legacy, according to Chadwick, the sports business expert.
For instance, the Barcelona Summer Games in 1992 spurred the city's urban regeneration as the remodeling of the waterfront development of the Olympic Village and harbor made beaches accessible to the public. Subway systems were extended and roads connecting the city were turbocharged, according to a report published in the journal Environment and Planning.

Similarly, nine years after hosting the 2012 Olympics, London has managed to draw business and visitors to Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park -- a former post-industrial district in the east of the British capital.
Lee, the sports diplomacy expert, said the 2024 Summer Games in Paris followed by the Los Angeles Games in 2028 show Western democracies still want to host the Olympics.
However, as host countries and their populations factor in the high economic and environmental costs of the Olympics, it is authoritarian regimes that have embraced the Games as a soft-power tool.
""Non-liberal emerging powers tend to stage the Olympics at all costs in order to impress world audiences,"" said Lee. 
For instance, China had never hosted the Olympics prior to 2008. But some 14 years after hosting its inaugural Summer Olympics, Beijing will become the first city to stage both Summer and Winter editions of the Games, in February 2022 -- an event, if successful, that could validate its authoritarian system, according to observers.
Future Games
In 2019, the IOC mapped out new rules that would require future bidders for Olympic host city to win a referendum at home before entering the race.
That move aimed to cut back on expensive bidding races and prevent wasteful ""white-elephant"" projects that cost a fortune to build but serve little purpose in the long run. 
For instance, Beijing's famous ""Bird's Nest"" stadium, built for the 2008 Games at a cost of $460 million, is not widely used today.
The rule changes may also pave the way for smaller cities to join the bidding for host city, Lee said.
The IOC's choice of Brisbane, provincial capital of Australia's Queensland, as ""preferred host"" for the 2032 Summer Games, shows the direction of the Olympics has already shifted, according to Lee.
Lee said the IOC picked Brisbane because the city had already hosted the 2018 Commonwealth Games jointly with the Gold Coast, also in Queensland. ""This means that Brisbane does not have to build new sporting facilities and athlete villages. This would make the Olympic Games in Brisbane a more sustainable choice than any other candidate cities for the 2032 Olympics,"" Lee said.
Additionally, Australia is one of the few Covid-safe nations in the world now, and this situation may have added a more competitive edge to Brisbane's Olympic campaign, he said.
Back near Tokyo, Kajiwara, the nurse, said last year she applied for a lottery, which covered 10 sports such as basketball, soccer, rhythmic gymnastics and track. She got a coveted ticket to watch the men's 100-meter final. She just hopes she can still go. 
","It was meant to be a curtain-raiser for thousands of sports fans, a celebration of Japan's recovery from nuclear disaster 10 years ago that would showcase a country emerging strongly from years of economic gloom. But the Grand Start of the Olympic Torch Relay in Fukushima was closed to the public on Thursday, as members of Japan's women's football team prepared to kick off the flame's 121-day domestic journey to Tokyo. Amid the pandemic, anyone not among the 300 invited participants and officials could only watch a livestream of the event at Fukushima's J-Village National Training Center.

How to help families of the spa shooting victims and all Asian Americans under attack,25/3/2021,"An elderly man on his daily walk was ambushed, shoved to the ground and killed. Strangers hurled insults and rocks at an Asian American family's home. A business owner's restaurant was spray-painted with ""Kung flu,"" ""go back 2 China"" and ""hope U die.""
Anti-Asian hate crimes have more than doubled during the pandemic, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.
But there are easy ways people of all backgrounds can help stop the vitriol and violence: 

Stop racist remarks when you see or hear them
If you see a friend joke about the ""China virus"" or ""kung flu"" on social media, reach out and explain why that's neither funny nor harmless. 
Words have consequences. Many Asian Americans have been spat on, attacked or erroneously blamed for the ""China virus,"" ""Chinese virus"" or the ""kung flu."" 
Those terms were popularized early in the pandemic. And researchers found that people who used the hashtag #chinesevirus on Twitter were more than twice as likely to show anti-Asian sentiment than those who used the hashtag #covid19.
Even Asian Americans who have never been to China have been accused and assaulted. And hate crimes against Asian Americans have increased by nearly 150% during the pandemic.
Take a (free) bystander intervention course
Bystander intervention courses arm you with the training needed to stop harassment and possibly prevent violence.
The anti-harassment group Hollaback! has teamed up with Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC to offer free, 1-hour online training to help you safely defuse xenophobia in action.
""We'll start by talking about the types of disrespect that Asian and Asian American folks are facing right now -- from microaggressions to violence,"" the registration website says. 
""We'll talk through five strategies for intervention: distract, delegate, document, delay, and direct; and how to prioritize your own safety while intervening ... and you'll leave feeling more confident intervening the next time you see Anti-Asian/American harassment online or in person.""
Support your local Asian American businesses
While many businesses have struggled over the past year, Asian American businesses have been hit disproportionately hard, fueled by discrimination and xenophobia.
According to the Pew Research Center, 44% of Americans surveyed said they or someone in their household suffered either a job loss or pay cut since February 2020. But among Asian Americans, that number rose to 54%.
The financial blow can be doubly devastating for immigrant families who don't have strong financial safety nets or don't yet have the language skills to compete for other jobs. 
""Unemployment severely impacted the more disadvantaged Asian Americans,"" wrote researchers from San Francisco State University and the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs.
In California, for example, 83% of the Asian American labor force with a high school education or less filed for unemployment claims in the first few months of the pandemic -- ""compared to 37% of the rest of the California labor force with the same level of education.""

We've seen how quickly racist vitriol can spread across social media. One way to counter that is to spread support instead of hate.
Facebook offers many frames to fit around your profile photo, including ""Stand against racism,"" ""Stop Asian hate"" and ""Stop AAPI hate."" 
Such messages can offer much-needed solidarity with Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, many of whom feel like they have targets on their backs. 
They can also help reduce the popularity of anti-Asian sentiment.
Donate to victims' families
The recent Atlanta-area spa shootings killed eight people, including six women of Asian descent. For some of the families, grief is now compounded by financial uncertainty.
One victim was a single mother and sole caretaker for two sons who have no other family in the US.
And at least two families are suffering extreme financial difficulty, said Charlie Yoon Kim, president of the Korean American Association of Greater Atlanta.
""They were worried about rents and utility fees and other practical costs, including the funeral process,"" he said.
GoFundMe has verified eight accounts that will directly benefit some of the families of those killed or injured in the March 16 attacks: 
-- Soon Chung Park: Park's widower said he is too overcome with grief to work. ""I am raising money to pay for my living expenses, including rent and bills, because I am currently unable to work due to the trauma I have experienced from this attack and from the death of my wife,"" Gwangho Lee wrote. ""I would be very grateful for any support that will allow me to get back on my feet after this terrible loss.""
-- Suncha Kim: ""Like many asian immigrants, she spoke very little English and worked two to three jobs. This took immense courage and my grandmother was a fighter,"" her family said in a written statement. ""As an immigrant, all my grandmother ever wanted in life was to grow old with my grandfather, and watch her children and grandchildren live the life she never got to live.""
-- Xiaojie Tan: Tan and her daughter Ying ""Jami"" immigrated to the US by themselves. ""Xiaojie loved her life in the US, and worked really hard to provide for her family -- she was financially supporting her sister and mother in China,"" said the GoFundMe page benefiting her daughter. Now, ""in the wake of this tragedy, Jami is separated from her Chinese relatives, by distance and by the pandemic."" 
-- Yong Ae Yue:  ""Mom was an amazing woman who loved to introduce our family and friends to her home-cooked Korean food and Korean karaoke,"" her youngest son wrote. ""The world will throw you trials and tribulations to test you, but this test feels so unfair. We are still in shock over the violent murder of our mother.""
-- Hyun Jung Grant: ""She was a single mother who dedicated her whole life to providing for my brother and I,"" her son wrote. ""It is only my brother and I in the United States. The rest of my family is in South Korea and are unable to come.""
-- Paul Michels: He's survived by a wife of 30 years, her restaurant manager said. The manager started an account for the family, saying, ""if anyone is willing to help, it would be greatly appreciated, anything will help, keep in mind this could have been you or one of your family members, so please help.""
-- Delaina Ashley Yaun: She was the mother of two children, including an 8-month-old girl. Yaun and her husband were both getting a massage when gunfire erupted. ""She was a good person,"" her sister said. ""She didn't deserve that. Nobody deserved it.""
-- Elcias Hernandez-Ortiz: ""He was shot in the forehead down to his lungs and into his stomach. He will be needing facial surgery,"" his wife wrote. ""Please help me and my family raise money to cover for my husband's medical bills. Please pray for my family and the family's that were affected by this shooting.""
GoFundMe said no verified account has been set up yet for the family of the remaining victim, Daoyou Feng, who was killed in the attacks.
Support groups that are fighting for change
Over the past year, more than 3,700 cases of discrimination, harassment or violence against Asian Americans have been reported, according to the advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate.
The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund works to protect and promote the civil rights of Asian Americans. It's fueled by donations and volunteer lawyers and law students. 
And Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC works to improve public education, public policy advocacy and community organizing to help build a more equitable society for all.
","Across the US, Asian Americans are under attack -- verbally, economically and physically.  An elderly man on his daily walk was ambushed, shoved to the ground and killed. Strangers hurled insults and rocks at an Asian American family's home. A business owner's restaurant was spray-painted with ""Kung flu,"" ""go back 2 China"" and ""hope U die."" Anti-Asian hate crimes have more than doubled during the pandemic, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. But there are easy ways people of all backgrounds can help stop the vitriol and violence:  Stop racist remarks when you see or hear them If you see a friend joke about the ""China virus"" or ""kung flu"" on social media, reach out and explain why that's neither funny nor harmless.  Words have consequences. Many Asian Americans have been spat on, attacked or erroneously blamed for the ""China virus,"" ""Chinese virus"" or the ""kung flu.""  Those terms were popularized early in the pandemic. And researchers found that people who used the hashtag #chinesevirus on Twitter were more than twice as likely to show anti-Asian sentiment than those who used the hashtag #covid19. Even Asian Americans who have never been to China have been accused and assaulted. And hate crimes against Asian Americans have increased by nearly 150% during the pandemic. Take a (free) bystander intervention course Bystander intervention courses arm you with the training needed to stop harassment and possibly prevent violence. The anti-harassment group Hollaback! has teamed up with Asian Americans Advancing Justice | AAJC to offer free, 1-hour online training to help you safely defuse xenophobia in action. ""We'll start by talking about the types of disrespect that Asian and Asian American folks are facing right now -- from microaggressions to violence,"" the registration website says.  ""We'll talk through five strategies for intervention: distract, delegate, document, delay, and direct; and how to prioritize your own safety while intervening ... and you'll leave feeling more confident intervening the next time you see Anti-Asian/American harassment online or in person.""

Myanmar's military is killing peaceful protesters. Here's what you need to know,25/3/2021,"Security forces, made up of police and military personnel and under the command of coup leader Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, have responded to demonstrations with increasing brutality, launching a countrywide systematic crackdown that includes shooting peaceful protesters and enforced disappearances.  
At least 138 people, including children, have been killed since the coup, according to the United Nations Human Rights office. And more than 2,100 -- including  journalists, protesters, activists, government officials, trade unionists, writers, students and civilians -- have been detained, often in nighttime raids, according to advocacy group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP). Though activists put both those figures as higher. 

Seizing power, Min Aung Hlaing detained democratically elected leaders -- including civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi -- ousted the ruling National League for Democracy government, and established a ruling junta called the State Administration Council. The commander-in-chief declared a state of emergency for one year, after which he said an election would be held.
Here's what you need to know about the situation.
Why did the Myanmar military seize power?
The military justified its takeover by alleging widespread voter fraud during the November 2020 general election, which gave Suu Kyi's party another overwhelming victory.
The Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) performed dismally in the poll, dashing hopes among some of its military backers that it might take power democratically -- or at least get to pick the next president.  The military then claimed -- without providing evidence -- there were more than 10.5 million cases of ""potential fraud, such as non-existent voters"" and called on the election commission to publicly release the final polling data. 
The commission rejected those claims of voter fraud.

It was only the second democratic vote since the previous junta began a series of reforms in 2011, following half a century of brutal military rule that plunged Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, into poverty and isolationism.
Analysts say the takeover was less about election irregularities and more about the military wanting to remain in control of the country, which would see another five years of reform under a second term of the NLD and Suu Kyi. 
Why is Myanmar protesting? 
Incensed the previous decade of reforms, which have seen political and economic liberalization and a transition into a hybrid democracy, would be undone, millions of people of all ages and social backgrounds have come out onto the streets daily across the country. 
Protesters are demanding the military hand back power to civilian control and are held fully accountable, and are calling for the release of Suu Kyi and other civilian leaders. Myanmar's many ethnic minority groups, which have long fought for greater autonomy for their lands, are also demanding the military-written 2008 constitution be abolished and a federal democracy be established.

The demonstrations, especially those taking up positions on the front lines behind barricades, are dominated by young people who have grown up with a level of democracy and political and economic freedoms their parents or grandparents didn't have, which they are unwilling to give up. 
Meanwhile, a civil disobedience movement has seen thousands of white- and blue-collar workers, from medics, bankers and lawyers to teachers, engineers and factory workers, leave their jobs as a form of resistance against the coup. 
The strikes have disrupted health care, banking, rail and administration services among others. Local media outlet Frontier Myanmar reported striking truck drivers, customs and bank agents, and port workers have brought international trade through Yangon's ports to a standstill.
How is the military responding?
In recent weeks, the military has stepped up its response to the protests. Footage and images on social media show crumpled bodies laying in pools of blood on the streets and young protesters clad in flimsy plastic helmets crouching for cover from police bullets behind makeshift shields. 
Amnesty International said the military is using increasingly lethal tactics and weapons normally seen on the battlefield against peaceful protesters and bystanders. Battle-hardened troops -- documented to have committed human rights abuses in conflict areas -- have been deployed to the streets, Amnesty said. The UN special rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, said the military's ""brutal response"" to peaceful protests is ""likely meeting the legal threshold for crimes against humanity.""
Under the cover of a nightly internet blackout, security forces go door to door in nighttime raids, pulling people from their homes. Many of those arbitrarily detained are kept out of contact from family and friends, their condition or whereabouts unknown.

At least four of the deaths in recent days were individuals arrested and detained by the junta, including two officials from the ousted NLD party. All four died in custody, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Family and activist groups alleged the two NLD officials were tortured.
The military has also sought to repress independent media, suspending the licenses of five outlets and arresting journalists. The Associated Press has demanded the release of its journalist Thein Zaw, who was detained and charged ""for simply doing his job"" while covering violent anti-coup demonstrations for the US news agency.
Despite the danger, thousands of young protesters have continued to defy the military and take to the streets each day, and local reporters and citizens journalists continue to risk their lives by livestreaming and documenting the crackdown. 
The junta has said it is using restraint against what it called ""riotous protesters."" In a speech published in state mouthpiece Global New Light of Myanmar, Min Aung Hlaing said the police force ""is controlling the situation by using minimum force and through the least harmful means.""
""The MPF is doing its work in accordance with democracy practices and the measures it is taking are even softer than the ones in other countries,"" he said. 
What has happened to Aung San Suu Kyi?
Suu Kyi was once celebrated as an international democracy icon. A former political prisoner, she spent 15 years under house arrest as part of a decades-long struggle against military rule.
Her release in 2010 and election victory five years later were lauded by Western governments as landmark moments in the country's transition to democratic rule after 50 years of military regimes.
Suu Kyi has been hit with four charges that could result in a years-long prison sentence and she remains under house arrest, having being detained by the military in the hours before the coup. Those charges, which have been called ""trumped up"" include one under the country's import and export act, the second in relation to a national disaster law, a third under the colonial-era penal code prohibiting publishing information that may ""cause fear or alarm,"" and the fourth under a telecommunications law stipulating licenses for equipment, her lawyer said.

The military has also accused the ousted leader of bribery and corruption. Military spokesperson Brig. Gen. Zaw Min Tun said in a news conference Suu Kyi accepted illegal payments worth $600,000, as well as gold, while in government. Her lawyer called the allegations a ""complete fabrication.""
Suu Kyi has not been seen by the public or her lawyers since she was detained. The ousted President Win Myint has also been detained since the coup and faces similar charges. 
Officials with the ruling NLD have either been arrested or gone into hiding since the coup. A group of former NLD lawmakers have formed a kind of parallel civilian parliament -- called the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) -- and are pushing for international recognition as the rightful government.
The group's acting leader Mahn Win Khaing Than has vowed to pursue a ""revolution"" to overturn the ruling junta.
What is the UN doing?
Protesters, activists and civilians have pleaded for the international community to intervene and protect Burmese people from the military's attacks. 
Various governments around the world have condemned the coup, while the US and UK have imposed sanctions on Myanmar's military leaders. The European Union has also said it is set to introduce targeted sanctions that could be expanded to include military-linked enterprises.
Last week, all 15 members of the UN Security Council unanimously backed the strongest sounding statement since the coup, saying it ""strongly condemns the violence against peaceful protestors"" and called on the military to ""exercise utmost restraint.""
UN diplomats told CNN that China, Russia, and Vietnam objected to tougher language calling events ""a coup"" and in one draft forced the removal of language that would have threatened further action, potentially sanctions.
China has not outright condemned the military takeover, but in comments following the Security Council agreement, UN Ambassador Zhang Jun said ""it is important the Council members speak in one voice. We hope the message of the Council would be conducive to easing the situation in Myanmar.""

Following the burning of Chinese-owned factories in Yangon this week, China has taken a more aggressive tone. The Chinese Embassy in Myanmar said ""China urges Myanmar to take further effective measures to stop all acts of violence, punish the perpetrators in accordance with the law and ensure the safety of life and property of Chinese companies and personnel in Myanmar,"" according to Chinese state broadcaster CGTN.
Many in Myanmar are becoming frustrated with mere words of condemnation and are demanding more meaningful action. 
Myanmar's ambassador to the UN, Kyaw Moe Tun, told CNN the UN Security Council's message ""does not meet the peoples' expectation."" And protesters can be seen holding signs reading ""R2P"" referring to a UN global political commitment called Responsibility to Protect, which seeks to ensure the international community never again fails to halt mass atrocities such as genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.
A group of 137 nongovernmental organizations from 31 countries have called on the UN Security Council to urgently impose a global arms embargo on Myanmar. 
Andrews, the UN special rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar, has urged member states ""to deny recognition of the military junta as the legitimate government."" He also called for an end to the flow of revenue and weapons to the junta, saying multilateral sanctions ""should be imposed"" on senior leaders, military-owned and controlled enterprises and the state energy firm, Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise.
","Daily protests have been ongoing for a month and a half in towns and cities across Myanmar after the military seized control of the Southeast Asian country in a coup on February 1. Security forces, made up of police and military personnel and under the command of coup leader Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, have responded to demonstrations with increasing brutality, launching a countrywide systematic crackdown that includes shooting peaceful protesters and enforced disappearances.

Biden to highlight gains and face tough scrutiny in first formal news conference,25/3/2021,"Biden is expected to highlight blasting through his 100 million doses in 100 days timeline and the passage of his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue bill, which, along with other social legislation in the planning stages, suggests that he is in the process of shaping the most progressive and ambitious Democratic presidency in decades. The doubling of the pace of vaccinations in the last two months represents tangible progress on the one issue on which Biden's first year will likely be mostly judged -- the quest to revive a semblance of normal life.
""Now is not the time to let down our guard. If we all do our part, after a long, dark year, we can show once again that we are the United States of America. ... We're going to beat this pandemic,"" Biden said in Ohio on Tuesday, striking the balance between caution and hope that has marked his management of the pandemic, which polls show wins the approval of a majority of Americans.
That is no doubt the message the White House hopes Americans will take away from the news conference Thursday afternoon. But the 78-year-old commander-in-chief can expect a grilling on a fast-expanding front of tough issues coming at his administration on all sides, which shows how quickly unforeseen events can challenge a president.
A surge in border crossings by migrant children appeared to catch a White House focused on the pandemic off guard and offered Republicans an opening as they seek to slow his momentum -- and build their 2022 attack lines against Biden's narrow Democratic congressional majority. 
Biden is also under pressure to explain how he can make good on his calls for sweeping gun control reforms after two mass shootings in a week and while opposing a rewrite of Senate filibuster rules, which appears the only way for Democrats to get new laws on the books amid staunch GOP opposition. The President must also appeal to all Americans to embrace the government's vaccination program as polls show many conservative voters reluctant to roll up their sleeves -- a trend that could threaten achievement of the herd immunity needed to end the pandemic. 
And after escalating rhetorical conflicts with nuclear-armed rivals Russia and China, Biden has a chance Thursday to explain the principles behind his foreign policy at a moment when rivals sense US weakness and are seeking advantage. And with its customary sense of timing, North Korea is testing the new commander-in-chief with missile launches that are ratcheting up tensions in a showdown that no president in the last 70 years has managed to solve.
The President has maintained approval ratings above 50% in his early months in office because he arrived with a mandate to tackle the pandemic head on and executed his agenda with a steady approach that was the antithesis of the erratic, combative presidency of Donald Trump. Though he was unable to win bipartisan congressional support for his American Rescue Plan, Biden had the backing of the American people to get it passed -- and could argue he was acting with bipartisan support nationally if not in Washington.
The White House has maintained a disciplined regime of televised events and strict messaging that recalled the successful approach of an election campaign that saw Biden make most appearances online because of the pandemic, save for well-executed scripted events like the Democratic National Convention and his participation in two presidential debates. But a rush of events in recent days has challenged that strategy, increasing calls among journalists for Biden to answer questions in a traditional setting. The President is holding his first formal White House news conference later in his term than his 15 most recent predecessors, who faced the music within 33 days of taking office, according to a CNN analysis of the last 100 years.
Battling to get a crisis under control
Unlike the coronavirus crisis that has killed more than half-a-million Americans, the issues that are now at the top of the nightly newscasts have defied bipartisan consensus for decades -- and will provide a severe test of the President's calls for national unity and cooperation between Democrats and Republicans. 
In the nearly two weeks since Biden signed the rescue bill -- at a time he had hoped to be taking a victory lap and explaining the elements of the legislation to voters -- he has confronted mass shootings in Atlanta and Boulder, Colorado, that took the lives of 18 people, entrenched racism directed at Asian Americans, and the humanitarian crisis at the border where the number of people apprehended could now be on pace to exceed the levels that the Trump administration faced in 2019. The White House's refusal to call the influx of children across the border a crisis -- after changing, on humanitarian grounds, the Trump-era rules under which kids were sent back to Mexico -- left the administration open to criticism that it had not thought through early immigration changes.
Two years ago, Democrats excoriated Trump administration officials for its handling of the crisis at the border. Now the problem is squarely within Biden's domain and government resources are once again strained to the brink as more than 600 unaccompanied children cross the Mexico border each day. 
As images emerge of children crowded together in plexiglass holding areas, sitting and sleeping on mats on the floor wrapped in Mylar blankets, it is the Biden administration that is facing charges of hypocrisy, inhumanity and a lack of transparency as children languish in Border Patrol facilities, akin to jail-like conditions, that the press hasn't had access to. Facing constraints related to the coronavirus pandemic, the Department of Health and Human Services hasn't been able to accommodate the growing number of arrivals. 
On Wednesday, the administration notified Congress of its intent to use a third convention center in San Antonio, Texas, to shelter the arriving children, and the Pentagon approved a request from HHS to temporarily house unaccompanied migrant children at two Texas military bases. The same day, a dozen retired Border Patrol chiefs who served in administrations from both parties called out congressional leadership for their inaction, noting that the US immigration system is outdated and not equipped to handle migrant families and children.
""We're not seeing any action. Our experience has taught us that now is the time to act. We need Congress to get on board. We need a recognition of the fact that there's a crisis on the Southwest border,"" Roy Villareal, who served as chief patrol agent in the Tucson sector from 2018 to 2020, told CNN's Priscilla Alvarez.
Minimal steps
With pressure mounting on Congress to direct more resources to the issue -- and on Biden to find a solution -- the administration took a minimal step toward transparency into border conditions by allowing a network pool camera to accompany members of Congress and White House officials to a Wednesday visit to a Texas facility holding unaccompanied migrant children. It's a facility intended for the care of children and an example of the types of shelters the administration has been scrambling to find more of -- unlike the Border Patrol facilities, which are supposed to be an interim step in the process.  
When questioned about the fact that the Biden administration has not allowed news cameras inside Customs and Border Protection facilities where children have been detained for longer than the three days allowed under law, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday the White House was looking for ways to increase access to journalists. 
""This is just the first step in a process of providing greater access to the media,"" Psaki said during a news briefing.
""We all agree that the Border Patrol facilities are not places where children should be. They are, children should be moving more quickly through those facilities. That is what our policy central focus is right now,"" Psaki said.
The lack of broad press access so far has called into question the administration's commitment to transparency, especially after the Trump administration's assaults on the press and Biden's repeated pledges to tell the American people the whole truth, no matter how bad a situation gets.
Vice President Kamala Harris, who was tasked by Biden Wednesday with overseeing the outreach to Central American countries to try to halt the flow of migrants to the US southern border, faced a preview of some of the difficult questions that Biden will encounter Thursday during an interview with CBS ""This Morning"" on Wednesday.
""It's a huge problem. I'm not going to pretend that it's not. It's a huge problem,"" Harris said in remarks that appeared to be somewhat of a do-over of the administration's initial downplaying of the situation.
""Are we looking at overcrowding at the border, in particular these kids? Yes. Should these kids be in the custody of HHS, the Health and Human Services, instead of the Border Patrol? Yes. Should we be processing these cases faster? Yes.""
""This is, however, not going to be solved overnight,"" the vice president said. 
The appointment of Harris is one of the most high profile efforts that Biden could make to stress the seriousness with which his administration is now taking the border crisis -- and offers a chance for the vice president to burnish her own political and foreign policy skills as she contemplates a possible run for the top job in future.
""I asked her, the VP today, because she's the most qualified person to do it, to lead our efforts with Mexico and the Northern Triangle, and the countries that can help, need help in stemming the movement of so many folks, stemming the migration to our southern border,"" Biden said on Wednesday.
But beyond Harris' new oversight role, Biden will face many more questions about how his administration can actually stop that movement across the southern border and create long-term solutions in partnership with Congress. As with so many of the intractable problems he is now facing, there aren't likely to be easy answers at his news conference Thursday. 
","President Joe Biden's first two months in power went remarkably smoothly considering he took office amid a once-in-a-century pandemic, a consequent economic crisis and his predecessor's refusal to recognize his victory. But in his first formal news conference Thursday, he'll face scrutiny on gun control and immigration, two sudden tests of leadership for which his administration has lacked immediate answers. Biden is expected to highlight blasting through his 100 million doses in 100 days timeline and the passage of his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue bill, which, along with other social legislation in the planning stages, suggests that he is in the process of shaping the most progressive and ambitious Democratic presidency in decades. The doubling of the pace of vaccinations in the last two months represents tangible progress on the one issue on which Biden's first year will likely be mostly judged -- the quest to revive a semblance of normal life. ""Now is not the time to let down our guard. If we all do our part, after a long, dark year, we can show once again that we are the United States of America. ... We're going to beat this pandemic,"" Biden said in Ohio on Tuesday, striking the balance between caution and hope that has marked his management of the pandemic, which polls show wins the approval of a majority of Americans. That is no doubt the message the White House hopes Americans will take away from the news conference Thursday afternoon. But the 78-year-old commander-in-chief can expect a grilling on a fast-expanding front of tough issues coming at his administration on all sides, which shows how quickly unforeseen events can challenge a president. A surge in border crossings by migrant children appeared to catch a White House focused on the pandemic off guard and offered Republicans an opening as they seek to slow his momentum -- and build their 2022 attack lines against Biden's narrow Democratic congressional majority.  Biden is also under pressure to explain how he can make good on his calls for sweeping gun control reforms after two mass shootings in a week and while opposing a rewrite of Senate filibuster rules, which appears the only way for Democrats to get new laws on the books amid staunch GOP opposition. The President must also appeal to all Americans to embrace the government's vaccination program as polls show many conservative voters reluctant to roll up their sleeves -- a trend that could threaten achievement of the herd immunity needed to end the pandemic.  And after escalating rhetorical conflicts with nuclear-armed rivals Russia and China, Biden has a chance Thursday to explain the principles behind his foreign policy at a moment when rivals sense US weakness and are seeking advantage. And with its customary sense of timing, North Korea is testing the new commander-in-chief with missile launches that are ratcheting up tensions in a showdown that no president in the last 70 years has managed to solve. The President has maintained approval ratings above 50% in his early months in office because he arrived with a mandate to tackle the pandemic head on and executed his agenda with a steady approach that was the antithesis of the erratic, combative presidency of Donald Trump. Though he was unable to win bipartisan congressional support for his American Rescue Plan, Biden had the backing of the American people to get it passed -- and could argue he was acting with bipartisan support nationally if not in Washington. The White House has maintained a disciplined regime of televised events and strict messaging that recalled the successful approach of an election campaign that saw Biden make most appearances online because of the pandemic, save for well-executed scripted events like the Democratic National Convention and his participation in two presidential debates. But a rush of events in recent days has challenged that strategy, increasing calls among journalists for Biden to answer questions in a traditional setting.

The US is sanctioning Chinese officials over alleged abuse of Uyghurs in Xinjiang. Here's what you need to know,25/3/2021,"The US State Department estimates up to 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities have passed through a sprawling network of detention centers across the region, where former detainees allege they were subjected to intense political indoctrination, forced labor, torture, and even sexual abuse. 
Human rights groups and overseas Uyghur activists have also accused the Chinese government of forced cultural assimilation and coerced birth control and sterilization against Uyghurs.
The former Trump administration officially determined that China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghur Muslims.
China vehemently denies allegations of human rights abuses, insisting the camps are voluntary ""vocational training centers"" designed to stamp out religious extremism and terrorism.
This week, the US along with the European Union, Canada and United Kingdom announced sanctions on Chinese officials over human rights violations in Xinjiang. In a joint statement, the grouping decried China's alleged ""use of forced labor, mass detention in internment camps, forced sterilizations, and the concerted destruction of Uyghur heritage.""
China responded almost immediately by imposing tit-for-tat sanctions, travel and business bans against 10 EU politicians and four entities. Both sides have doubled down, with European leaders accusing China of being ""confrontational"" and Beijing accusing the EU of ""grossly interfering"" with its internal affairs.
Here's what you need to know about Xinjiang and the allegations of atrocities.
Where is Xinjiang and who lives there?
Xinjiang, officially the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, is a vast and remote region in China's far west. Stretching 1.6 million square kilometers (640,000 sq miles) from the Tibetan plateau in the southeast to Kazakhstan on its northwestern border, it is by far China's largest administrative region, but one of its least densely populated. 
An ethnically diverse region, it is home to a variety of minority ethnic groups, including Hui, Kazakhs, and the largest group, the Uyghurs, who speak a language closely related to Turkish and have their own distinct culture.
Xinjiang is rich in natural resources, especially oil and natural gas. The central government has made a concerted effort to develop the region's economy -- prompting a large-scale influx of China's ethnic majority Han population in recent decades.
Historically, Uyghurs had been the majority in the region. Now, they account for just under half of Xinjiang's total population of 22 million, and many of them live in the southern, rural part of Xinjiang.
The region is geographically strategic for Beijing. Xinjiang is China's gateway to Central Asia, bordering Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, as well as Mongolia and Russia in the north and Pakistan and India in the south.
What led to the crackdown?
Xinjiang's minority groups have long felt marginalized and left out of the economic boom, claiming widespread employment discrimination in state-controlled industries that have dominated the local economy.
Government-backed restrictions on religious practice and customs that are central to their Islamic identity since the 1990s have also served to stoked inter-ethnic tensions and occasional violence. 
In recent years, Beijing has tightened its grip on the region. A turning point came in 2009, when ethnic riots in Urumqi, the regional capital, resulted in the deaths of at least 197 people, leading to a government clampdown that saw widespread and lasting restrictions placed on minority Muslim groups. 
The government has also linked Uyghurs to attacks in Xinjiang and other parts of China. Beijing has blamed Islamist militants and separatists for the violence, though it is disputed how many of these incidents are linked to, or directed by overseas militant groups.
In recent years, Beijing has ramped up restrictions on Islam in the name of fighting terrorism. The crackdown includes banning veils, long beards and Islamic names, cracking down on Quran study groups, and preventing Muslim officials from fasting for Ramadan.
The clampdown has further escalated after Communist Party hardliner Chen Quanguo was put in charge of Xinjiang in 2016. Chen, the former Party boss in the neighboring Tibet Autonomous Region, unleashed a series of security measures, installing a network of manned checkpoints and artificial intelligence-powered surveillance cameras to track people's daily routines. Authorities also collected residents' biometric data and conducted spot checks on their phones to scan for content deemed to be problematic or suspicious.

What are the detention camps?
The biggest step China has taken in its crackdown is its network of detention camps across the region. Former detainees have described experiencing political indoctrination and abuse inside the camps, such as food and sleep deprivation, forced injections, forced sterilizations, abortions and gang rape. 
They were shackled and forced to live in poor conditions; one detainee said she was put in a cell with 20 other women, and was only allowed to use the toilet once a day for three to five minutes. Those who took longer were electrocuted with shock batons, she said.

In a report released in March, Amnesty International estimated there may be thousands of Uyghur children who have been separated from their parents for years as a result of the government's tightening grip on Xinjiang.
Initially, Beijing flatly denied the existence of the camps. But it later claimed the facilities are voluntary ""vocational training centers"" where people learn job skills, Chinese language and laws. The government now insists that the camps are necessary for preventing religious extremism and terrorism.
Leaked Chinese government documents, however, revealed people can be sent to a detention facility for simply ""wearing a veil"" or growing ""a long beard."" Those disappeared into the camps also include Uyghur intellectuals and artists -- people who would not need vocational training as the Chinese government has claimed.
The documents, together with other first-hand reports, paint an alarming picture of what appears to be a strategic campaign by Beijing to strip Uyghurs of their cultural and religious identity and suppress behavior considered to be unpatriotic. 
The Chinese government has challenged the authenticity of leaked records.

How has the world responded?
The treatment of Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang has been widely condemned by the international community. In July 2019, 22 countries signed a letter urging China to end its ""mass arbitrary detentions and related violations"" and called on Beijing to allow UN experts to access the region.
But many Muslim-majority countries have stayed silent over China's crackdown in Xinjiang, and some even voiced support for Beijing. Just four days after the letter condemning China's Xinjiang policies was submitted to the United Nations, 37 countries, including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Syria, Russia and North Korea, wrote to the UN and praised China for its ""remarkable achievements in the fields of human rights"" in Xinjiang.
In January this year, the US officially determined that China is committing genocide and crimes against humanity against Uyghurs. A month later, the Dutch and Canadian parliaments passed similar motions despite opposition from their leaders.
The US also banned imports of cotton products and tomatoes produced in Xinjiang over forced labor concerns.

In March, a non-governmental organization undertook an independent legal analysis of the genocide accusations -- and what responsibility Beijing may bear -- for the first time. The report, conducted by more than 50 global experts, concluded the Chinese government's alleged actions have violated every single provision in the United Nations' Genocide Convention.
Days before the report was released, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said allegations of genocide ""couldn't be more preposterous."" The Chinese government has repeatedly defended its actions in Xinjiang, saying citizens now enjoy a high standard of life, and calling the accusations a smear campaign by foreign forces.
The sanctions declared this week are some of the strongest and most unified actions taken in protest of the Uyghurs' treatment, seemingly meant to isolate and pressure Beijing.
The US targeted Wang Junzheng, the Secretary of the Party Committee of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and Chen Mingguo, Director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau. Meanwhile, the EU sanctioned Zhu Hailun, former head of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and three other top officials, for overseeing the detention and indoctrination program.
But none of the sanctions so far has mentioned Xi Jinping, China's most powerful leader in decades, who has called his government's Xinjiang policy ""completely correct.""
","The United States and its allies are stepping up pressure on China in a unified show of force against Beijing's alleged repression of Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority, in the country's western region of Xinjiang.  The US State Department estimates up to 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities have passed through a sprawling network of detention centers across the region, where former detainees allege they were subjected to intense political indoctrination, forced labor, torture, and even sexual abuse.  Human rights groups and overseas Uyghur activists have also accused the Chinese government of forced cultural assimilation and coerced birth control and sterilization against Uyghurs.

Why Biden's first press conference will be so challenging,25/3/2021," 
Seared in my memory as a former White House adviser is a lesson President Joe Biden's team is learning today: Hard as you try to drive a message, major unforeseen events intrude, diverting public attention and demanding your response.
 
When the White House announced eight days ago that Biden would hold his first formal press conference on Thursday, his team probably hoped to use the exchange with reporters to tout progress on the Covid-19 vaccine rollout and the virtues of his signature American Rescue Act which greenlighted stimulus checks, as well as more aid for the unemployed and Americans facing eviction, and additional support for small businesses.
 
Since then, two mass shootings -- in the Atlanta area and in Boulder, Colorado -- have rekindled demands for federal action for stricter gun laws. While the pace of vaccinations rapidly accelerates, the number of Covid cases has climbed as states across the country are beginning to reopen. Illegal border crossings by unaccompanied minors are increasing, as is friction among factions of the Democratic base.
 
As if that weren't enough, rhetorical salvos have flown between the US and its two most irksome adversaries, China and Russia, portending challenging days ahead.  And on the eve of the press conference came news of provocative new ballistic missile tests by North Korea.
 
In fact, a week that was supposed to feature presidential events to lift up and underline the Rescue Act has yielded entirely different and vexing storylines that you can be sure will dominate Thursday's session.
 
Eager to avoid unforced rhetorical errors, Biden's team did a brilliant job throughout the general election campaign of controlling his interactions with the news media, mitigating the risk of unintended stories. That has continued during his first weeks in office. Americans mostly have heard from their new President in scripted remarks.
 
It's in marked contrast to his ubiquitous predecessor, who was always eager to share every thought -- well-founded and truthful or not.
 
Biden has done relatively few interviews. (In fairness, even Trump limited most of his interviews to the fawning precincts of Fox News.)
 
As president, Biden participated last month in a televised CNN town hall with citizens, a format that allowed him to display his prodigious empathy and decency, with limited opportunity for follow-ups from the moderator.
 
Thursday's event will be a more challenging format, with reporter questions and follow-ups.
 
Biden may choose in an opening statement to make an announcement that he hopes will drive the news coverage. He will be furnished with a list of questioners, carefully curated by the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki. As is customary, he will have spent hours prepping with his team.
 
But rigorous though his prep may be, Biden and his team can only guess at the nature of the questions, many of which will be shaped by the events of the past week and even the hours before he takes the podium.
 
Some questions may come with a twist. Last week, in one of Biden's rare interviews, ABC's George Stephanopoulos asked the President whether he thought Vladimir Putin is a ""killer."" Biden paused, but after a moment of hesitation said, ""I do."" His blunt characterization of the Russian president touched off a diplomatic furor and probably was not the news the White House wanted to make.
 
When he steps up to the podium Thursday, Biden's aides and advisers will be hoping that the questions he hears will be familiar and the news he makes intended. That podium, with the presidential seal affixed, is a powerful platform but there is no guarantee.
 
Buffeted by unanticipated events and lines of questioning -- and complicated by the President's tendency to occasionally drift off point -- the White House communications machine is hard to control.
 
Thursday will be an interesting test for this nascent presidency.
","Running White House messaging is like driving a high-performance race car. The machine is powerful but it is easy at any moment to spin off the track.   Seared in my memory as a former White House adviser is a lesson President Joe Biden's team is learning today: Hard as you try to drive a message, major unforeseen events intrude, diverting public attention and demanding your response.   When the White House announced eight days ago that Biden would hold his first formal press conference on Thursday, his team probably hoped to use the exchange with reporters to tout progress on the Covid-19 vaccine rollout and the virtues of his signature American Rescue Act which greenlighted stimulus checks, as well as more aid for the unemployed and Americans facing eviction, and additional support for small businesses.   Since then, two mass shootings -- in the Atlanta area and in Boulder, Colorado -- have rekindled demands for federal action for stricter gun laws. While the pace of vaccinations rapidly accelerates, the number of Covid cases has climbed as states across the country are beginning to reopen. Illegal border crossings by unaccompanied minors are increasing, as is friction among factions of the Democratic base.   As if that weren't enough, rhetorical salvos have flown between the US and its two most irksome adversaries, China and Russia, portending challenging days ahead.  And on the eve of the press conference came news of provocative new ballistic missile tests by North Korea.   In fact, a week that was supposed to feature presidential events to lift up and underline the Rescue Act has yielded entirely different and vexing storylines that you can be sure will dominate Thursday's session.   Eager to avoid unforced rhetorical errors, Biden's team did a brilliant job throughout the general election campaign of controlling his interactions with the news media, mitigating the risk of unintended stories. That has continued during his first weeks in office. Americans mostly have heard from their new President in scripted remarks.   It's in marked contrast to his ubiquitous predecessor, who was always eager to share every thought -- well-founded and truthful or not.   Biden has done relatively few interviews. (In fairness, even Trump limited most of his interviews to the fawning precincts of Fox News.)   As president, Biden participated last month in a televised CNN town hall with citizens, a format that allowed him to display his prodigious empathy and decency, with limited opportunity for follow-ups from the moderator.   Thursday's event will be a more challenging format, with reporter questions and follow-ups.   Biden may choose in an opening statement to make an announcement that he hopes will drive the news coverage. He will be furnished with a list of questioners, carefully curated by the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki. As is customary, he will have spent hours prepping with his team.   But rigorous though his prep may be, Biden and his team can only guess at the nature of the questions, many of which will be shaped by the events of the past week and even the hours before he takes the podium.   Some questions may come with a twist. Last week, in one of Biden's rare interviews, ABC's George Stephanopoulos asked the President whether he thought Vladimir Putin is a ""killer."" Biden paused, but after a moment of hesitation said, ""I do."" His blunt characterization of the Russian president touched off a diplomatic furor and probably was not the news the White House wanted to make.   When he steps up to the podium Thursday, Biden's aides and advisers will be hoping that the questions he hears will be familiar and the news he makes intended. That podium, with the presidential seal affixed, is a powerful platform but there is no guarantee.   Buffeted by unanticipated events and lines of questioning -- and complicated by the President's tendency to occasionally drift off point -- the White House communications machine is hard to control.   Thursday will be an interesting test for this nascent presidency.",opinions,OPINION
"Chinese threat to Taiwan 'closer to us than most think,' top US admiral says",25/3/2021,"""My opinion is this problem is much closer to us than most think,"" Adm. John Aquilino said before the Senate Armed Services Committee, which was reviewing his nomination to lead the US military's Indo-Pacific Command.
China considers establishing full control over Taiwan to be its ""number one priority,"" added Aquilino.
The current head of the command, Adm. Philip Davidson, told a hearing earlier this month that China could be prepared to take Taiwan, the self-governed democratic island that Beijing claims as its sovereign territory, by force within the next six years.
But Aquilino said Beijing is establishing a track record of using force to achieve Communist Party goals sooner than US planners forecast.

""We've seen aggressive actions earlier than we anticipated, whether it be on the Indian border or whether it be in Hong Kong or whether it be against the Uyghurs. We've seen things that I don't think we expected, and that's why I continue to talk about a sense of urgency. We ought to be prepared today,"" Aquilino said.
Aquilino did not provide an exact timeframe on when China might attempt a military takeover of Taiwan, nor did he cite any new or specific intelligence in support of his claim.

Mainland China and Taiwan have been governed separately since the end of a bloody civil war in 1949, but Beijing has vowed to never allow the island to become formally independent, and has refused to rule out the use of force if necessary.
""Taiwan is an inalienable part of China,"" Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Senior Col. Wu Qian said in January. ""The PLA will take all necessary measures to resolutely defeat any attempt by the 'Taiwan independence' separatists, and firmly defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.""
China is also adamant its military is defensive.
""The development of China's national defense aims to meet its rightful security needs and contribute to the growth of the world's peaceful forces,"" the country's 2019 defense white paper said. 
Admiral accuses China of 'aggressive posture'
But Davidson, in his Senate testimony two weeks ago, said the Chinese military has built a force intended for offensive operations.
""I cannot for the life of me understand some of the capabilities that they're putting in the field unless it is an aggressive posture,"" he told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
""I see them developing systems, capabilities and a posture that would indicate that they're interested in aggression,"" Davidson said.
Aquilino said Tuesday the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is sharply focused on having all it needs to bring Taiwan under Beijing's control.
""The military threat to Taiwan is increasing. The PLA continues to field a broad array of advanced weapons and systems as part of ongoing force modernization specifically intended to achieve decisive overmatch against Taiwan,"" the US admiral said in written testimony.
For instance, analysts note that Beijing has been building a force of warships like helicopter landing docks and large amphibious assault ships that could be useful in taking islands.
Aquilino, the current commander of the US Navy's Pacific Fleet, said Washington needs to increase deterrence capabilities in the Pacific, noting what has been done regarding China to date, including sending US warships through the Taiwan Strait and exercising dual aircraft carrier strike groups in the South China Sea, has not been effective.
""We certainly haven't changed their desire, nor intent, nor ability to execute the largest military buildup we've seen in a while,"" Aquilino said.
Asked by senators why the US must defend Taiwan, Aquilino said Washington's credibility as an ally to places like Japan and the Philippines is at stake if the island were to fall to Beijing.
""It would negatively impact our standing in the region if that were to happen and it would challenge the rest of our allies and partners and the US, negatively impacting our ability to operate freely in the area,"" he said.
Aquilino also told the senators that a Chinese military presence on Taiwan would give Beijing sway over two thirds of global trade, which passes through the sea lanes near the island.
The admiral ended the hearing asking the senators to fully fund the Pentagon's Pacific Deterrence Initiative, a list of new weaponry and defensive measures to the tune of $4.6 billion.
""I do believe that sends a strong message that the entirety of government in the United States is focused on the challenge that we've identified as it applies to the western Pacific,"" Aquilino said.
Biden administration takes strong stance
The Indo-Pacific command nominee's comments follow weeks of strong anti-China rhetoric and military displays since the Biden administration took office in January.
During a visit to Japan earlier this month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken listed some of Washington's grievances with Beijing. 
""China uses coercion and aggression to systemically erode autonomy in Hong Kong, undercut democracy in Taiwan, abuse human rights in Xinjiang and Tibet, and assert maritime claims in the South China Sea that violate international law,"" he added. ""We will push back if necessary when China uses coercion or aggression to get its way.""
Just last week, talks in Alaska between Blinken and senior Chinese diplomats got heated, with China accusing the US of  ""provoking dispute"" by launching ""unreasonable attacks"" on China's domestic and foreign policies, according to state-run broadcaster CCTV.
The US military, meanwhile, has been sending its guided-missile destroyers through the Taiwan Strait, the waterway separating the island from the Chinese mainland, and challenging Beijing's claims in the South China Sea with so-called Freedom on Navigation operations (FONOPS) -- actions that have ramped up in recent years under Aquilino's command.
China says operations such as these show it is the US that undermines stability and ratchets up tensions in the Indo-Pacific.
","China is quickly amassing weapons and systems to militarily overwhelm Taiwan, an action it could be poised to take within the next six years, the admiral chosen to be the next commander of US forces in the Pacific warned Tuesday. ""My opinion is this problem is much closer to us than most think,"" Adm. John Aquilino said before the Senate Armed Services Committee, which was reviewing his nomination to lead the US military's Indo-Pacific Command.

Biden reaches out to some Republicans on Capitol Hill -- but not party leaders,25/3/2021,"""We just talked about Burma -- an issue that I've had a long-time interest in,"" McConnell told CNN of their February conversation, though he previously said they also spoke about the budget process and Covid relief during that call.
But the White House has a different account.
""He speaks with him regularly,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday, declining to elaborate other than to mention a ""long friendship"" between the two men who served for more than two decades together in the Senate.
When pressed for more details, Psaki demurred, saying, ""I don't have any more calls, I don't think, to read out for you, which we will not make a case of doing.""
To top Republicans on Capitol Hill, the discrepancy underlines the argument they've been making: That despite his promise to unify Washington, the new President has abandoned his campaign pledge to court the other side. And even as they unify in opposition to his agenda, while plotting to take back Congress in the midterms next year, Republicans argue the lack of outreach feeds into their case that the new President is beholden to the most liberal elements of his party and has little interest in finding consensus with the GOP.
""The story is what happened to the Joe Biden of old,"" said South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, whom Biden called a ""personal disappointment"" in December. The two haven't spoken since he took office.
While Biden has been in touch with key Republican swing votes in the Senate (Susan Collins of Maine), had a cordial call with the most senior GOP senator in recent weeks (Chuck Grassley of Iowa), and also been in touch on China issues with one of his sharpest GOP critics (John Cornyn of Texas), his outreach to party leaders has been scant, according to GOP senators and aides.
The new President hasn't spoken with House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy since Inauguration Day. He has yet to speak to the House's No. 2 Republican, Steve Scalise, since he became President, nor has he reached out to the Senate's GOP whip, John Thune. 
Yet Biden also hasn't spoken to a Senate Republican who could be open to deal-cutting on legislation dealing with gun violence: Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.
""Nope,"" Toomey, whose bipartisan plan to expand background checks on firearm sales has been stalled for eight years, said when asked if he had heard from Biden on the issue.  
Has he heard from Biden at all since January 20? 
""No,"" Toomey said.
Before taking office, Biden often boasted about his ability to work across the aisle, even in a deeply-divided Washington. He pointedly told skeptics during the transition: ""Watch me. Watch me.""
But since then, in the wake of Republicans standing in lockstep against his agenda, a new definition of bipartisanship has emerged. Privately, Biden told Senate Democrats in a virtual meeting this week that bipartisanship is defined by what voters say, not what McConnell thinks, according to a person familiar with his remarks. And his aides have echoed a similar sentiment.
""He doesn't believe that bipartisanship is defined by zip code here,"" Psaki said Wednesday at the White House briefing. ""He believes it's on how we can deliver relief to the American people.""
Collins says she has suggested that Biden meet once a week with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and McConnell, as was the case when top party leaders regularly met with then-President George W. Bush when the chamber was in session during his time in office. That has not been the case so far.
""I would love to see that re-initiated,"" Collins said.
Democrats argue that more Republicans need to show some willingness to cooperate, while noting that many Republicans even refused to recognize the legitimacy of Biden's victory for months.
White House officials says they have been forced to limit larger meetings due to the pandemic, but they also note there have been regular bipartisan meetings in addition to outreach with senior aides, including one recently on infrastructure. In his first meeting with lawmakers, Biden invited a group of 10 GOP senators to discuss Covid-19 relief, although he later moved ahead with a $1.9 trillion relief plan backed by just Democrats after rejecting the Republican approach as inadequate.
Democrats say that the President and his top aides have been in regular communication with lawmakers on both sides, and argue the approach is vastly different than that of Donald Trump, who as President spoke to mainly the most loyal of Republicans and didn't speak with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the final 15 months of his term.
""The very first group that he invited to the White House was 10 Republicans,"" said Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who occupies the Senate seat Biden held for 36 years.
Yet some Republicans who have reached out to the White House say they've heard nothing back -- whether it's McCarthy's ask for a meeting on immigration or Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, on energy policy.
""The promise to be bipartisan has been probably one of the emptiest political promises I have ever seen in my lifetime,"" Cramer said.
But while many Republicans haven't heard from the President, some have gotten his attention.
Some Republicans have spoken with the President 
Biden has picked up the phone to speak with some Republicans, including Grassley, the most senior Senate Republican, who told CNN he and Biden had a ""friendly conversation"" that lasted about two minutes a few weeks back. Grassley told him they could work together to reduce prescription drug prices. 
Asked what prompted the call, Grassley said of his former Senate colleague: ""I did something he liked."" 
Grassley added: ""He's got abysmal policies but you can't help but like the guy."" 
Collins, a key centrist Republican who worked with Biden for many years when he was in the Senate, said she has had several good conversations with Biden since he became President.

""My personal conversations with the President have been both productive, gracious, welcoming,"" she said, while acknowledging some of her early interactions with some of Biden's top staff were frustrating, although she believes those issues are behind them now after she had a ""constructive conversation"" with Biden's chief of staff Ron Klain last week. 
Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman has attended two meetings with Biden -- one on the Covid relief bill and a second to discuss legislation pushing back on China. 
""I wish they would be more interested in working with us on a bipartisan basis. If you think about it. What have we done on a bipartisan basis? Really nothing,"" said Portman who noted that he's voted for most of Biden's nominees, something he considers a bipartisan act.  ""I'm talking to the White House trying to encourage them to do more.""
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican, was at the White House's infrastructure meeting, in addition to the one about Covid-relief. She said she's satisfied with the White House outreach, but when asked if she were satisfied the President and his team were listening to her suggestions, she let out a laugh.
""That's a different question,"" Capito said. 
Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, echoed that Biden's outreach has been good on China issues and concerns about vulnerable supply chains. He attended one ""good meeting"" on that issue at the White House that Biden attended. Cornyn said there's been ""good follow through"" from the White House on that too.
He said he suspects the people around Biden are worried former President Barack Obama tried to do too much outreach to Republicans and it limited their ability to get their agenda passed.  
""That's the only thing that we've seen bipartisan outreach,"" he said. ""In a 50-50 Senate, it is true they can jam some things, but I think they are going to be leaving a lot of things on the table that they might otherwise be able to do.""
White House officials would not discuss the number of interactions Biden has had with Republicans of late.
""We're obviously not going to read out all those calls, and I expect that will continue,"" Psaki said of the outreach.
But after McConnell said in a Fox News interview Wednesday that he has not spoken with Biden ""since he was sworn in,"" the GOP leader later clarified to CNN he only spoke with Biden on the issue of Burma.
Later in the day when asked about Psaki's claim of his regular discussions with the President, McConnell walked into the chamber and didn't answer.

30 questions for Biden's first press conference,25/3/2021,"A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
But after four years of former President Donald Trump's constant tweeting and talking to reporters outside the White House, Biden's measured statements, carefully chosen outings and rare forays in front of reporters make him seem downright quiet. 
His first news conference Thursday might be the first time most Americans will see him take questions in the more than two months since he took office. He'll likely argue he's done as much or more than most new presidents -- and his $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill is a very big deal.
The remarks are scheduled for 1:15 p.m. ET, in the middle of the day, when most people are probably working. Trump usually scheduled things for prime time.
I've got a lot of questions for him, although like most people I won't get to ask them (CNN's White House reporters will handle that). 
So I went around to some smart people at CNN -- Tami Luhby, who covers health care; Katie Lobosco, who covers economic policy; Katelyn Polantz, who covers criminal justice; Chris Isidore, who covers the auto and airline industries; Priscilla Alvarez, who covers immigration; and Jennifer Hansler, who covers diplomacy -- and asked what's on their minds.
With their input, what follows is a not very short and still not comprehensive list of what Biden should be asked.
Will you get more ambitious on Covid?
The US easily met your goal of putting 100 million vaccine shots in arms in less than 100 days and you want most Americans to have the ability to get vaccinated by May. What more ambitious goals will you set for the country to achieve with regard to Covid? 
How will you make the vaccine distribution more equal?
There is still a clear discrepancy in states and communities -- some are doing much better than others at getting Covid vaccine out there. Track them here. What are you going to do starting tomorrow to bring all of the country in line? 
How can we convince people to take the vaccines? 
The next major problem of vaccines won't be access, it will be apprehension, particularly among communities of color and, conversely, White conservatives. What approaches will you take to reach these two very different groups? More specifically, will White conservatives listen to you? 
What's next on schools? 
Even in places where kids are returning to school, it's often not a majority of kids who are actually in school. Statistics and polling suggest it is more often White families that are sending their kids back when given the opportunity. Will it be a failure if a year from now there are proportionally more White kids getting in-person education than kids of color? 
You're spending A LOT of money. Trillions and trillions.
You signed a $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill into law. You're looking at a $3 trillion infrastructure package. That's $5 trillion in new spending. Why shouldn't Americans be alarmed at this rate of spending, and how in the heck are we going to pay for all of it? The country was running $1 trillion budget deficits before you took office. 
How will you raise taxes? 
When will we see your plans to increase taxes on wealthy Americans and corporations? 
What's a win on Covid relief? 
Your American Rescue Plan cost $1.9 trillion. Besides reaching full employment next year, how else will you measure its success?
Have you given up on the minimum wage? 
One thing dropped from the Covid bill was the $15 federal minimum wage. What's your strategy for getting a $15 minimum wage passed if you need at least 10 Republican votes. What do you say about the Congressional Budget Office estimate that the higher minimum wage would lead to the loss of 1.4 million jobs? 
Will you back electric cars? 
Sens. Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein have asked you to set a date after which the sale of gasoline-powered cars will be banned. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has already signed an executive order banning the sale of those cars by 2035, and GM says it wants to move to all electric cars by then. Are you ready to endorse such a rule? 
What about Tesla and unions? 
Your executive order calling for the federal government to buy electric cars and trucks when possible said that one of its goals is to spur ""the creation of union jobs in the manufacture of those new vehicles."" But the world's largest maker of electric vehicles is Tesla, which is nonunion. Does that mean that you don't believe the government should buy electric vehicles from Tesla? 
Too much bailout for airlines? 
The US airline industry has received more direct government help than any other sector -- $54 billion to at least temporarily prevent layoffs. Was that a fair and good use of that money, or should the money have been spread around other parts of the economy, including other parts of the travel and tourism industry that did not receive that kind of help?
What will you do if the economy overheats? 
A growing number of economists -- some of them Democrats -- are concerned the US government is spending too much money and the economy could overheat. If there are signs the government is overheating, is there a plan to deal with that problem? 
When will you end Trump's tariffs? 
Trump's China tariffs have cost American importers $82 billion so far. Do you plan to lift those tariffs, and if so, when? 
What should be done about misinformation online and Trump's new platform?
There are reports that Trump will start his own social media platform. What should the US government do to regulate such a platform and is it the business of the federal government to regulate fake news online?
Make the ending-child-poverty experiment permanent? 
You frequently tout that the American Rescue Plan will reduce child poverty by more than half, but several key provisions last only one year. What will you do to make the changes to the child tax credit, earned income tax credit and other measures permanent?
How will you proceed on student loan debt? 
You have said you support canceling up to $10,000 in student loans per borrower. Are you willing to take executive action to do so? 
Do you back Trump's prescription drug plan? 
You've taken some steps to bolster the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid. What will you do to reduce the cost of prescription drugs? Do you support any of the efforts the Trump administration started, including importing drugs from Canada and tying prices here to those in other countries? 
Are you ready to expand the Supreme Court? 
Voters put you in the White House and gave Democrats control of the Senate last November. But because the Constitution has been interpreted to give justices lifetime appointments, the court has a new conservative majority that could last generations. Do you believe there should be more than nine Supreme Court justices as a way to make the court more responsive to the American people?
What if the new conservative court takes away Obamacare? 
What will you do if the Supreme Court overturns the Affordable Care Act? Do you have an alternative plan in the works?
Why not end the filibuster? 
There are majorities in Congress right now to pass gun control, voting rights legislation, climate change legislation, immigration revisions and more. Proposals on all of these policies have languished for years, and in some cases decades, because senators insist on a supermajority to pass any legislation. Can you explain to your fellow Democrats why you don't support ending the filibuster right now?
Are you sidestepping a border crisis? 
Your administration has tried very hard not to call the situation at the border a crisis. Many thousands of unaccompanied minors have been apprehended and by sheer numbers, the influx of migrants could eclipse what occurred during the Trump administration. At what point will you agree that this is a crisis? 
How did this border situation happen? 
What more should have been done early on in your administration to prepare so thousands of children didn't languish in Customs and Border Protection custody for extended periods? What will you do now that so many kids are at the border?
Do these Democratic senators have a point? 
Two US senators, both of them Asian American, threatened to boycott your Cabinet nominees because you haven't nominated Asian Americans. Do you agree that your Cabinet has a diversity problem? Regardless, what will you do to assuage the concerns of these senators, without whom you may not be able to confirm nominees?
The US has been at war in Afghanistan for 20 years. 
The Trump administration agreed to a peace deal that would have US troops out of the country by May 1. Will you stick to that deadline? 
Can you work with the Taliban?
Do you believe that the Taliban have upheld their commitments under the 2020 deal with the US? 
What are you waiting for? 
Your secretary of state reaffirmed at NATO that the US and allies would leave Afghanistan together ""when the time is right."" What specifically needs to happen for the time to be right? 
What are your views on the insurrection?
Do you believe Trump and others at the January 6 rally incited the crowd to overrun Congress? 
Is there evidence of sedition?
A Justice Department prosecutor told ""60 Minutes"" he personally thinks Capitol rioters should be charged with sedition. Do you agree?  
Should presidents get special protection? 
Do you believe presidents and their top advisers should be given special protection from congressional and other investigations after they leave office, merely because of the position they held? 
How do you measure up to Obama? 
Please compare your accomplishments so far to those of former President Barack Obama at this point in his presidency.
How's life at the White House? 
Do White House employees need to steer clear of your dog?
","It's not that President Joe Biden keeps quiet, exactly.  But after four years of former President Donald Trump's constant tweeting and talking to reporters outside the White House, Biden's measured statements, carefully chosen outings and rare forays in front of reporters make him seem downright quiet.  His first news conference Thursday might be the first time most Americans will see him take questions in the more than two months since he took office. He'll likely argue he's done as much or more than most new presidents -- and his $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill is a very big deal. The remarks are scheduled for 1:15 p.m. ET, in the middle of the day, when most people are probably working. Trump usually scheduled things for prime time. I've got a lot of questions for him, although like most people I won't get to ask them (CNN's White House reporters will handle that).  So I went around to some smart people at CNN -- Tami Luhby, who covers health care; Katie Lobosco, who covers economic policy; Katelyn Polantz, who covers criminal justice; Chris Isidore, who covers the auto and airline industries; Priscilla Alvarez, who covers immigration; and Jennifer Hansler, who covers diplomacy -- and asked what's on their minds. With their input, what follows is a not very short and still not comprehensive list of what Biden should be asked. Will you get more ambitious on Covid? The US easily met your goal of putting 100 million vaccine shots in arms in less than 100 days and you want most Americans to have the ability to get vaccinated by May. What more ambitious goals will you set for the country to achieve with regard to Covid?  How will you make the vaccine distribution more equal? There is still a clear discrepancy in states and communities -- some are doing much better than others at getting Covid vaccine out there. Track them here. What are you going to do starting tomorrow to bring all of the country in line?  How can we convince people to take the vaccines?  The next major problem of vaccines won't be access, it will be apprehension, particularly among communities of color and, conversely, White conservatives. What approaches will you take to reach these two very different groups? More specifically, will White conservatives listen to you?  What's next on schools?  Even in places where kids are returning to school, it's often not a majority of kids who are actually in school. Statistics and polling suggest it is more often White families that are sending their kids back when given the opportunity. Will it be a failure if a year from now there are proportionally more White kids getting in-person education than kids of color?  You're spending A LOT of money. Trillions and trillions. You signed a $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill into law. You're looking at a $3 trillion infrastructure package. That's $5 trillion in new spending. Why shouldn't Americans be alarmed at this rate of spending, and how in the heck are we going to pay for all of it? The country was running $1 trillion budget deficits before you took office.  How will you raise taxes?  When will we see your plans to increase taxes on wealthy Americans and corporations?  What's a win on Covid relief?  Your American Rescue Plan cost $1.9 trillion. Besides reaching full employment next year, how else will you measure its success? Have you given up on the minimum wage?  One thing dropped from the Covid bill was the $15 federal minimum wage. What's your strategy for getting a $15 minimum wage passed if you need at least 10 Republican votes. What do you say about the Congressional Budget Office estimate that the higher minimum wage would lead to the loss of 1.4 million jobs?  Will you back electric cars?  Sens. Alex Padilla and Dianne Feinstein have asked you to set a date after which the sale of gasoline-powered cars will be banned. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has already signed an executive order banning the sale of those cars by 2035, and GM says it wants to move to all electric cars by then. Are you ready to endorse such a rule?

March 24 coronavirus news,25/3/2021,,"Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb said the state expects to hit a major milestone of one million Indianans fully vaccinated on Wednesday.? ""Whether that's a two-dose to the arm or a one dose [Johnson & Johnson] we'll hit today, one million,"" said Holcomb during a news conference Wednesday. ""We are not just on the road to recovery we are onward and upward.""? As of Tuesday night, nearly 19% of eligible Indianans have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, and 32% of the state population has received at least one dose, said State Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box.? The state plans to open vaccine eligibility to all individuals age 16 and older starting March 31.?? Additionally, Holcomb said the state will continue to operate mass vaccination sites. Starting April 1, a vaccination site at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway will open for 16 days, where the state expects to administer 96,000 vaccinations. ##Vaccines## Reports of extremely rare blood clots should not deter governments from distributing the AstraZeneca vaccine to their citizens, according to the World Health Organization¨s Chief Scientists Soumya Swaminathan.? The vaccine¨s reputation is being hit in public perception due to news coverage, Swaminathan said. ＾This is what happens when science is played out on the front pages of newspapers and television channels,￣ Swaminathan told CNN on Wednesday. ＾We scientists are used to reading these papers once they are peer-reviewed and published in scientific journals. We are not used to science by press release, but that¨s what¨s happening now.￣? She noted that the vaccine has already been widely deployed, with 20 million doses administered in Europe, 30 million in India, and another 10 to 15 million in Africa.? ＾And there's definitely no?relationship between the more?common clotting disorders or?thrombotic events and the?vaccine.?What the WHO recommended is?that the benefits of this?vaccine clearly outweigh the?risks,￣ she said. Meanwhile, the WHO is continually monitoring data coming in every day about whether the current vaccines are effective against several major variants gaining prevalence around the world, Swaminathan said.? ＾Currently our recommendation is to go ahead with the available vaccines as we learn more, and of course, we are working with manufacturers as they develop the next version of their vaccines,￣ she explained. ＾So we might have vaccines next year, for example, that will address the variants in addition to the original strain. And that¨s something for which WHO is involved in a global coordination.￣? Swaminathan said new European Union proposals for stricter export controls on Covid-19 vaccines are a?＾self-defeating exercise.￣  On Wednesday, EU commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis announced that the EU has proposed tighter controls on the export of Covid-19 vaccine doses. ＾We really want to focus on?identifying what are those?obstacles, roadblocks, what are?those supply chain issues that?can be solved??But, again, this needs working?together,￣ Swaminathan said. ＾It needs leaders, it needs the?CEOs of the companies to reach?out to each other, including many?companies in the developing?world, which are available and?eager and wanting to participate?in this effort.?So these are the kind of?solutions we need to look?forward to increase supplies?rather than, you know, fighting?and putting in export bans,?which is really ultimately a?self-defeating exercise,￣ she said. ##Vaccines##? The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declined to act on a cruise industry request to lift its no-sail order Wednesday, saying current rules will stay in effect until November. The Cruise Lines International Association said it had asked the Biden administration to lift the no-sail order for cruise ships by early July, saying that timeline ＾is in line with President Biden¨s forecast for when the United States will be ｀closer to normal.¨￣?? The CDC said its order would stay in place. ＾On October 30, 2020, CDC issued Framework for Conditional Sailing Order (CSO) that remains in effect until November 1, 2021. Returning to passenger cruising is a phased approach to mitigate the risk of spreading Covid-19. Details for the next phase of the CSO are currently under interagency review,￣ the CDC said in a statement to CNN. President?Biden?announced the release of $81 billion in funding from the Covid-19 relief bill for school reopenings Wednesday, part of the administration¨s efforts toward getting the majority of schools opened in his first 100 days in office and addressing inequity caused by the pandemic. ＾I¨m really proud to announce that starting today, states will begin receiving nearly $130 billion in school funding that we included in the American Rescue Plan. In fact, $81 billion of those dollars will be arriving today to those schools,￣?Biden?said during a virtual summit on school reopening hosted by the Department of Education. Biden?called on states to take the next steps, saying, ＾I need states to move quickly to get these resources down to the school districts and put them to work.￣ The President also?reiterated his message that ＾help is here.￣ ＾Help is here for schools to purchase PPE, hire additional personnel like nurses, counselors, custodial staff, improve ventilation and sanitation, avoid devastating layoffs and give students extra support,￣ he said, adding, ＾Help is here to help students make up for lost time and lost learning. Unless we act quickly,?this pandemic could have a devastating long term impact on our kids who have gone through this, including on their mental health.￣ More on the funds: The administration is releasing funding for schools as part of the $1.9 trillion Covid relief package to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, on Wednesday. The bill included $122 billion in relief for Pre-K to 12 schools, and two-thirds of those funds, totaling $81 billion, ＾will be made available to states immediately,￣ the Department of Education said in a statement.  The funds, the statement said, will ＾support their efforts to get students back in the classroom safely for in person learning, keep schools open once students are back, and address the academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs of all students.￣ The additional one-third of funding, per the Department of Education, ＾will become available after states submit the plans they are developing and implementing for using (emergency relief) funds to safely reopen schools and meet the needs of students to the Department.￣ Part of the funding for schools will be used to address educational inequity that has only been exacerbated by the pandemic, with Education Secretary Miguel Cardona outlining inequity in the return to in-person learning. Vice President Kamala Harris expressed concern for students disproportionally impacted, explaining how the funding could help address those challenges. ＾We're all worried about our students falling behind, especially those who attend schools that are underfunded and under-resourced, and especially our students who have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Those who are learning English, students with disabilities, students without access to broadband, students who are food insecure and so many more,￣ Harris said. The money for schools, she said, includes ＾evidence-based interventions that will help bridge the gaps in learning and meet social and emotional needs in the wake of the pandemic.￣ One specific measure aimed at addressing that is summer learning and enrichment opportunities, with?Biden?calling on states, school districts, and community partners to work together on the matter. The European Union and the United Kingdom are working together on specific steps ＾to create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply,￣ they said in a joint statement on Wednesday.? ＾We are all facing the same pandemic and the third wave makes cooperation between the EU and UK even more important,￣ the statement read. ＾We have been discussing what more we can do to ensure a reciprocally beneficial relationship between the UK and EU on COVID-19.￣ ""Given our interdependencies, we are working on specific steps we can take C in the short, medium and long term C to create a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for all our citizens,￣ they said.? The statement goes on to say that global cooperation not just between the two, but with all countries will be key to overcoming this pandemic and future challenges, with the two sides vowing to continue discussions.? ##Vaccines## People with Covid-19 symptoms will need to be tested for Covid-19 well into the future, University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy director Michael Osterholm said Wednesday. ＾We¨re going to need to test people who have potentially clinically compatible symptoms with Covid-19 forever,￣ Osterholm said during a webcast on the state of Covid-19 testing hosted by Axios. ""This virus is not going away around the world,￣ he said.?＾Remember, we have billions of people in low-income countries, some in middle-income countries, who will never have access to vaccines, and where those cases are occurring in those countries, we¨ll also see variants spread out.￣ Osterholm said testing would also be helpful in tracking the effectiveness of vaccines and determining the need for booster doses. ##Vaccines## Almost 130.5 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered in the United States, according to data published Wednesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC reported that 130,473,853 total doses have been administered C about 77% of the 169,223,125 doses delivered. That¨s nearly 2.3 million more doses reported administered since yesterday, for a seven-day average of about 2.5 million doses per day.  A month ago, the seven-day average was about 1.5 million, with about 1 million fewer doses being administered per day, according to a CNN analysis of CDC data. And in less than two months, the pace of vaccination has doubled. About 26% of the population C almost 85.5 million people C have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 14% of the population C more than 46 million people C are fully vaccinated, CDC data shows.?A third of adults and about 70% of seniors have received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine. Data published by the CDC may be delayed, and doses may not have been given on the day reported. ##Vaccines## The?European Union is proposing tighter Covid-19 vaccine export controls, which could affect the US and the UK.? The tougher export controls would see vaccine shipments assessed based on the destination country's rate of vaccinations and vaccine exports.  CNN's Melissa Bell has the latest from Paris, France. Watch:  ##Vaccines## A new large scale international review of rapid Covid-19 tests finds that few of them meet the World Health Organization¨s minimum acceptable performance standards.? There are two kinds of rapid tests C molecular tests, including PCR, which are considered to be the gold standard of molecular diagnostics; and rapid antigen tests, which detect proteins of the virus. Proponents of rapid tests say these diagnostics can be utilized?to quickly screen individuals as businesses and society continue to re-open. Airlines already are already employing rapid tests to screen passengers for flights.? When looking at the antigen tests, the independent research group Cochrane, a collaborative of researchers and health professionals from 130 countries, found the were best used within the first week after someone began experiencing symptoms. In those conditions, the tests correctly identified 78% of people with Covid-19. Overall, when used to test among people who were symptomatic, rapid antigen tests positively identified 72% of people who had Covid-19.? When the antigen tests were used among people who were asymptomatic, the tests were much stronger at ruling out infection than identifying it. The tests correctly identified a negative Covid-19 finding about 99% of the time in people who just had Covid-like symptoms or no symptoms at all. However, when tested among people with a positive Covid-19 diagnosis, the rapid antigen tests only identified them correctly 58% of the time.? The reviewers also found a wide discrepancy in accuracy among the tests C ranging from 34% to 88%.?The WHO¨s minimum standards require a test to identify at least 80% of people with an infection and 97% of those without an infection.?The SD Biosensor STANDARD Q and the Abbott Panbio antigen tests were identified as the two most accurate tests reviewed.? When looking at the rapid PCR tests, the researchers found that on average they positively identified an infection 95% of the time, and correctly identified a negative diagnosis 99% of the time. However, the researchers noted that there were limitations to these findings, because most of the studies evaluated looked just at the Abbot ID Now and Xpert press rapid PCR tests. There wasn¨t enough data to evaluate when the tests were most precise relative to symptom onset.? Mexico's Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard announced the country had received 12 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses that remain at the final packaging process to start the distribution for Mexico and Latin American countries. ""Today we're going to receive an additional six million doses so we'll have in total 18 million doses at the Liomont laboratory; they're at the final process to start the distribution in Mexico and Latin America, to the countries that have contracts or orders; from the third week of April, once all procedures have been completed,"" Ebrard announced Wednesday from the National Palace. The foreign minister said Mexico and Argentina had promoted vaccine access to the region and went on to say, ""We've proposed this with other vaccines and companies, but so far, in Mexico, we're also producing CanSino, and they're willing and have contracts with Latin America."" Mexico on Monday announced the first batch of China's CanSino Biologics vaccine ！940,022 doses ！were produced and packaged in the country. Ebrard said the country is very close to starting distributing the AstraZeneca vaccine in Latin America, saying, ""this would be a great step for Latin America and the Caribbean; we can act together, we can solve these important challenges, and we can guarantee that our people have access to what they're entitled to."" Pan American Health Organization Director Carissa Etienne said Tuesday that 33 of 35 member states had started immunizations, and 21 countries in the Americas will receive their first deployment of vaccines by the end of this week. Correction: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated the additional number of Covid-19 vaccines that Mexico received from AstraZeneca. ##Vaccines##? Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said about three-quarters of students in the US are back to some form of in-person learning, commending the work of local districts on reopening during the National Safe School Reopening Summit on Wednesday. Cardona said more than 45% of elementary and middle schools are offering in-person school daily, and about 75% of schools have?some form of in-person learning, like a hybrid method, according to new data from the National Center for Education Statistics. ""That's a great start,"" Cardona said. ""We must continue that so every school K-8 offers in-person learning five days a week. There are still inequities when it comes to in-person learning, Cardona said. ""Only 28%?of black students are going to school in-person daily, 33% of Latino students are doing it,"" Cardona said. ""15% of our Asian students are going to school in-person daily. That's compared to half of white students that are doing daily throughout our country."" Some of these inequities will be addressed with the funding from the Biden administration's American Rescue Plan, which is providing more than $122 billion for K-12 schools to go towards reopening. ""We can address those inequities that I just talked about with that we can safely reopen our schools when we have to act wisely and with urgency to get it done,"" Cardona said. ##Restrictions## A senior European diplomat is urging caution over the use of proposed new rules that would govern exports of Covid-19 vaccines to outside of the EU. The rules were announced by the European Commission earlier Wednesday. The tougher export controls put forward by the Commission would see vaccine shipments assessed based on the destination country's rate of vaccinations and vaccine exports. In a briefing to journalists, the diplomat said the EU and European countries need to, ＾be careful with the very the nuclear option of a pure export prohibition.￣ And if not used correctly in, ＾appropriate situations, it will backfire.￣ ＾We speak as C I would say C a pharma superpower, we have a huge concentration of pharmacological companies on our territory,￣ whose presence, ＾counts for several percentages of our employment, of GNP,￣ the diplomat explained. ＾We are very much aware of the interdependence of these logistical chains, and we think that, using a tool of an export blocking could turn itself very quickly against ourselves,￣ the diplomat said, adding he fears ＾it will expose us to clearly retaliation measures, breach of trust, and also future diminished possibilities for investments and trade.￣ The existing export mechanism C which focuses on pharmaceutical firms C has been in place since the end of January and requires each company manufacturing Covid-19 vaccine to register its intention of exporting doses outside of the EU. European countries in collaboration with the Commission decide whether to approve or reject shipments. In figures released today by the Commission, over 300 applications were made, with 43 million vaccines exported to 33 countries. Only one shipment of 250,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from Italy to Australia was blocked. The diplomat welcomed this ＾excellent by-product￣ of the current mechanism. ＾We understand of course the need for more transparency, we are squarely behind the Commission in that respect,￣ adding that, ＾we have now a very precise view on how the export flows are organised.￣ Asked why the expanded legislation was being brought forward now, the diplomat said they felt it, ＾probably it is a sign of some nervousness which is reigning,￣ in some European counties.? ＾The Commission is not deaf for what lives in member states, they hear cries for help or indignation, and it's up to the Commission to reflect on that and to put proposals on the table,￣ he added. European leaders will meet on Thursday and Friday to discuss this proposal and the wider coronavirus crisis in Europe. If signed off, the expanded export mechanism would ＾apply until six weeks from its entry into force,￣ according to the Commission¨s draft text. ##Vaccines## More new research suggests that Covid-19 vaccines are effective in preventing Covid-19 in the real world, Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Biden, said during a White House virtual briefing on Wednesday. ""Right now, as the weeks go by, we see more and more that not only are these vaccines efficacious but in the community they are extremely effective in preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2,"" said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the virus that causes Covid-19. Two new papers, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Tuesday, have added to that growing body of research. One study of employees at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Texas found that among those who were fully vaccinated, the infection rate was 0.05%. That was compared with?2.61%?of?the non-vaccinated employees and 1.82%?of?the partially vaccinated employees.?The other study, on?fully vaccinated workers at the University?of?California, San Diego and the University?of?California, Los Angeles, also showed a very small positivity rate after vaccination. ""Now, 70% of Americans 65 years of age or older have received at least one dose,"" Fauci said. ""Every day, 2.5 to 3 million people get vaccinated. So, every day we get closer and closer to that extraordinary degree of effectiveness, which we're seeing at the community level C and at the end of the day, that is what it is that is going to end this pandemic in this country."" ##Vaccines## Watch:  Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Wednesday that the latest Covid-19 data in the United States has her worried. ""Cases continue to increase slightly. The most recent seven-day average is nearly 55,000 per day, up about 3% from the prior seven-day average.?The most recent seven-day average of new hospitalizations is about 4,600 per day and is similar to the data on Monday. And the latest seven-day average of deaths ！ approximately 968 per day ！ has also remained flat this week,"" Walensky said during a White House virtual briefing on Wednesday. ""I continue to be worried about the latest data, and the apparent stall we are seeing in the trajectory of the pandemic,"" Walensky said. ""CDC is watching these numbers very closely."" Walensky added, ""We have made such extraordinary progress in the last several weeks, and if we choose to invest in prevention right now, we will ultimately come out of this pandemic faster and with fewer lives lost."" She applauded the pace of Covid-19 vaccinations in the United States. ""I've been so impressed by the pace of vaccination,""?Walensky said during the briefing. ＾So many Americans have embraced vaccination and have chipped in with their families and communities to help others get vaccinated,"" Walensky said.?""We are now vaccinating between 16 and 20 million people a week ！ and this means that we are closer to resuming activities we love to do with those we care about the most."" ##Hotspots## ##Vaccines## Hear her concern:? US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky touted ＾substantial progress￣ toward vaccinating the nation¨s educators Wednesday as the Biden administration¨s deadline to get school staff vaccinated by the end of the month approaches. ＾We've been working hard with our federal retail pharmacy program to vaccinate K through 12 teachers, staff, and childcare workers throughout the month of March. Our pharmacy partners now report they have vaccinated more than 1.3 million educators, staff and childcare workers, about 566,000 of those were just in the last week,￣ Walensky said. She continued, ＾This is substantial progress towards our goal of getting our teachers and school staff vaccinated by the end of March.￣ There were about 3.7 million teachers in the fall of 2020, per the National Center for Education Statistics. This progress comes as the Department of Education is set to hold a summit on the safe reopening of schools Wednesday afternoon, with President Biden expected to announce $81 billion in funding for states toward supporting reopening measures via the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. ＾During the summit, we will continue the important dialogue of school reopening and hear firsthand experience from school administrators, teachers, staff, and students about how they have been able to successfully get back to in person learning,￣ Walensky said. ##Vaccines## The antiviral drug remdesivir shortens the duration of illness even among non-White patients, who have a higher risk of severe disease, doctors reported Wednesday. The study, published in the journal JAMA Network Open, adds to evidence the drug can relieve the burden of coronavirus illness, even if it¨s not a cure. Remdesivir,?sold under the brand name Veklury, was approved in October. It was the first drug to get full approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for use in treating Covid-19. ＾Receipt of remdesivir was associated with faster clinical improvement in a cohort of predominantly non-White patients,￣ Dr. Brian Garibaldi of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and colleagues wrote in their report. Garibaldi was among the team of doctors who treated then-President Trump for a coronavirus infection last year.? The team looked at the records of 2,483 patients with Covid-19 treated in the Johns Hopkins system. Of those, 342 received remdesivir, and 184 of these patients also received corticosteroids. And while patients given remdesivir were less likely to die, the findings on this were not statistically significant, the team said.? Only very ill patients got remdesivir C those with low oxygen levels and indications of organ damage. ＾Our study included a much higher percentage of patients from underrepresented minority groups than previous remdesivir clinical trials. Approximately 80% of patients in our cohort were non-White individuals compared with 30% to 47% in clinical trials,￣ the team wrote. ＾Because underrepresented minority groups have shouldered a disproportionate burden during the COVID-19 pandemic but have not been widely represented in clinical trials, our results provide important evidence that receipt of remdesivir is associated with decreased time to clinical improvement in these populations,"" they wrote.  ? As more states expand coronavirus vaccine eligibility to anyone 16 and older in the general population, local health officials are growing concerned that demand may become more of a challenge than supply.?? It could happen?within the next four to six weeks, Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN on Wednesday morning.? ＾We will get to the point pretty quickly where we're saying, ｀OK now we're into the really hard phase of this where we're down to the population that is not so willing to get the vaccine,¨ ￣?Freeman said.? ＾That¨s important to think about in the context of ！ how far have we really gotten towards overall blanketing the country with vaccine uptake? And how far off are we in terms of the herd immunity component? Because it's that last mile of people that are hesitant that will be challenging,￣ Freeman said. ＾It will happen, I think, pretty quickly. We'll be thinking, talking, putting effort on this within the next four to six weeks.￣? ?##Vaccines## Iraq has reported the highest daily cases since the start of the pandemic after 6,051 Covid-19 daily cases were recorded on Wednesday, according to the country's Ministry of Health.? The total number of cases in Iraq since the pandemic began is 809,092 as per government figures. The ministry also recorded 29 new coronavirus related deaths, bringing the total number of recorded deaths in Iraq to 14,095 since the start of the pandemic.? There are currently 67,526 Covid-19 patients hospitalized across the county, among them 476 cases in ICUs. The Iraqi government announced an?easing of?lockdown?restrictions last week?saying the country faced economic challenges during the lockdown. ""We must rethink our approach in confronting coronavirus, without impacting people's livelihood and their economy,"" Iraqi government spokesman Hassna Nadhim said during a press conference last week. Current restrictions: The country now has a lockdown on Fridays and Saturdays instead of Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The daily curfew has been reduced by one hour, and is now between 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. local, while malls, shops, restaurants, and cafes were reopened on March 22 under strict health measures. ##Hotspots##  ##Restrictions## The European Union has proposed tighter controls on the export of Covid-19 vaccine doses, EU Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis announced on Wednesday. The new rules would most likely affect countries with higher vaccination rates than the EU, including the United States and the United Kingdom. The tougher export controls would see vaccine shipments assessed based on the destination country's rate of vaccinations and vaccine exports. ?Going forward, the European Commission and member states will consider two additional elements: reciprocity and proportionality, Dombrovskis said. ""If a country of destination which has a large production capacity restricts its own exports of vaccines or substances, either by law or by other means, it may be appropriate to consider whether exports to this country are justified,"" he said. ?""The second element is proportionality, which means finding the right balance. Member states of the Commission will consider the conditions prevailing in the country of destination ！ in particular, epidemiological situation, its vaccination rate, and existing availability of Covid-19 vaccines,"" Dombrovskis continued. The objective of the change is to ""have more transparency on exports and obtain a full picture of what is happening outside the EU so as to avoid a possible circumvention of the rules,"" Dombrovskis said. ?Exports to low- and middle-income countries supplied through the COVAX scheme and exports to EU overseas countries and territories would not be affected because they have an unconditional exemption. European leaders will meet on tomorrow and Friday to discuss this proposal and the wider coronavirus crisis in Europe. If signed off, the export mechanism would ""apply until six weeks from its entry into force,"" the draft text said. ##Vaccines## Uruguayan President Luis Lacalle Pou announced new restrictive measures that will be in place until April 12 to curb the spread of Covid-19. Public offices will be closed except for essential services and in-person learning for all levels of education will also be suspended. Clubs, gyms, amateur sports, public shows, parties and social events will also be suspended, and restaurants and bars will close at midnight. ＾Free shops￣ on the border with Brazil, duty free shops where Brazilians shop to resell in their cities, will also be closed.? ＾If the free shops are a hub (for risks), well we close them￣ said Uruguay¨s President at a news conference on Tuesday night. Uruguay¨s neighbor Brazil is one of the world¨s worst affected countries by the pandemic, with intensive care units overwhelmed, cases rising, and some essential medical supplies running low. It has the second highest number of cases of the virus and deaths, only exceeded by the United States. The President also said the number of ICU beds in the country will be increased with 35 additional beds to the private sector, 10 to the military hospital and 84 to the public sector.  ＾Stay in your bubble, stay with your close family,￣ Lacalle said. Uruguay set a record for new cases and deaths on Monday with 2,700 new cases and 19 new deaths. Also, on Monday, health authorities said 24 cases of the Brazilian P.1 variant were detected in the country. The country also set a record on the same day for number of active cases- 14,418 and a record for number of people in?ICU C 188. On Tuesday, the country recorded 1,801 new cases of the virus for a total of 86,007 cases since the pandemic began, according to the country¨s health ministry. Also, on Tuesday, 16 additional virus-related deaths were recorded bringing the total death toll to 827. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) highlighted a surge in cases in Uruguay, at its weekly press conference on Tuesday. PAHO Director Dr. Carissa Etienne said Uruguay has reported more than 1,000 cases per day several times in the past few weeks ＾which is alarming given the size of the country.￣  The current population of Uruguay is 3,482,469 as of March 24, 2021, based on Worldometer elaboration of the latest United Nations data. ?##Restrictions## ##Hotspots## ##Variants## Belgium will close schools until April 19, but nursery schools will stay open and exams will be taken, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo said Wednesday.

Dow rebounds in a roller coaster week,24/3/2021,,"It was another tough day on Wall Street for most of the FAANGs and other Big Techs, as investors fled growth stocks for value sectors. But the Dow held up a little better, thanks to gains in cyclical oil and industrial giants such as Chevron (CVX), Dow (DOW), Caterpillar (CAT), Honeywell (HON) and 3M (MMM.) Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reiterated their hopes for a continued recovery during testimony before the Senate Banking Committee  about Covid-19's impact on the economy. Long-term bond yields stabilized, too, giving a boost to bank stocks.  The Dow was flat. The S&P 500 was down 0.6%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2%. As stocks settle after the trading day, levels might still change slightly. Non-fungible tokens are all the rage these days. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's first tweet just sold as an NFT for nearly $3 million. Toilet paper brand Charmin has an NFT, and there's even a digital house that fetched a half million dollars. Heck, the CNN Business tech team has splurged on its very own feline-themed token.  So is this mania for investing in NFTs starting to look like an irrationally exuberant bubble? Yes and no.  Lo Toney, founding managing partner of Plexo Capital, told?CNN's?Alison Kosik on the Markets Now show Wednesday that investors should watch what millennials and Gen Zers are doing.  ""Without a doubt, you need to look at younger generations for the future of investing,"" he said, noting that NFTs are a great way for artists to generate longer-term royalty streams through the sale of tokens.  That said, shares of several companies have surged this week for no other reason than the companies are planning (or might plan) some sort of NFT strategy. Collectibles maker Funko (FNKO) soared 10% Tuesday and was up more than 10% Wednesday on NFT hopes for selling digital tokens tied to its pop culture figurines.  Shares of digital entertainment firm Cindeigm (CIDM), Canton, Ohio-based football-themed company Hall of Fame Resort & Entertainment (HOFV) and marketing firm Dolphin Entertainment (DLPN) have also surged this week thanks to NFT news and chatter.  That's where things are starting to get a bit bubblicious.  ""Is this a little overheated?"" Toney said on the Markets Now show. He answered his own question by saying that he was seeing more and more companies putting out press releases touting their NFT strategy. It's been a bumpy ride for tech stocks lately. But that's not scaring away one top VC from the sector. Lo Toney, founding managing partner of Plexo Capital, told CNN's Alison Kosik on the Markets Now show that he ""absolutely"" remains bullish on tech stocks for the long haul. ""Right now, the market is trying to sort things out,"" he said about the volatility in the Nasdaq. Toney said that Tesla (TSLA) is one of the stocks that he likes, but he feels that a recent price target of $3,000 that Cathie Wood's ARK Invest put on the stock is extreme.  ""I'm an enormous Elon Musk fan and huge bull, but at $3,000 it is going to have to be priced to perfection to reach that target,"" he said. Toney said that one of his favorite tech stock picks right now is Adobe (ADBE), the software giant that has many tools geared toward the burgeoning creator community of people running their own online video, blogging and social media businesses.  ""Adobe is a very interesting company in the creator economy. There are all these individuals doing things under their own shingle,"" he said.  Toney also does not fear the possibility of more federal regulations  from the Biden administration on Big Tech and social media firms.  ""This has been a long time coming,"" Toney said, adding that a hands off approach from regulators 20 years ago was ""the right thing to do"" but that ""we're at a point now where tech is so intertwined in our lives and there are repercussions geopolitically."" ""We need to take a step back and understand the challenges,"" he said, noting that as long as the government doesn't overstep, investors have already priced in more tech regulations. With more states legalizing the use and sale of marijuana for consumers, the CEO of one Canadian cannabis company thinks the industry is about to become a lot more lucrative.  Miguel Martin, who runs Aurora Cannabis (ACB), told CNN's Alison Kosik on the Markets Now show that there is ""no question"" that Aurora is well on its way to achieving profitability now that the US, Mexico and many other markets are opening up for legal pot sales. Martin also said that he expects the US Food and Drug Administration to play a more active role in cannabis regulation going forward.  But the big challenge for his firm and other cannabis stocks, he said, is that the there has been an ""arms race"" going on in many countries where legal recreational cannabis use is still relatively new. Companies have had to spend a lot to attract consumers. ""It's only recently that there has been focus on fundamentals, and that's not just for Aurora. But we're on the right track,"" he said. The good news, he added, is that the medical marijuana business is profitable and has ""heathy"" margins.  As for the company's volatile stock price, which is up more than 10% this year but trading more than 50% below its 52-week high, Martin said he doesn't blame analysts for being skeptical. ""We have to?prove to Wall Street that we can consistently deliver profitability, he said, adding that ""the future is bright for cannabis."" He argued that Aurora has a good business model and will be a great long-term investment. Last year was a challenging one for many investors -- but especially for women starting their own companies. Venture capital funding for female-led companies fell more than 25% in 2020. But Anu Duggal, founding partner of Female Founders Fund, told CNN's Alison Kosik on the Markets Now show that ""2021 is off to a great start"" for women in the tech sector. Duggal pointed out that social media firm Bumble (BMBL), led by Whitney Wolfe Herd, enjoyed a strong debut when it went public. And genetic testing firm 23andMe, led by Anne Wojicki, is going public through a merger with a Richard Branson-backed special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. ""There are so many ares where there is innovation and there is a ton of liquidity,"" Duggal said about other female-led startups. She said her firm is particularly excited about consumer, health care and social media companies.   ""Given the work from home environment, which to a certain degree is here to stay, there is a need for community,"" Duggal said. And that's a big reason why her firm has invested in Peanut, a social media firm geared toward mothers, as well as Co-Star, an astrology and zodiac app.    Senator Elizabeth Warren teed off on fellow Democrat Janet Yellen today over a disagreement about what makes a company ""too big to fail."" Although Congress a decade ago gave regulators the ability to scrutinize extra-big banks with assets of $50 billion or more, it also said non-banks could be included in the ""too-big-to-fail"" list as well.  So Warren wanted to know why Treasury Secretary Yellen and the Biden administration weren't more concerned that BlackRock manages $9 trillion in assets -- more than the annual GDP of any country not named the United States or China. ""If a $9 trillion investment company failed would that likely have a significant impact on our economy?"" Warren asked Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. After a back and forth about a focused investigation performed by the Treasury under former President Donald Trump, Yellen conceded that she thinks ""it's appropriate to designate institutions whose failure would pose a material risk to US financial stability,"" and pledged to investigate further. Warren, not too happy with the response, called for more immediate action. ""When the party is going strong, it's the job of the regulators to take away the punchbowl,"" she said. ""My view on this is Congress gave you the tools to monitor the risk and it is important to use them."" It's another weird day on Wall Street. Tech had been leading the charge this morning as bond yields fell yet again. That gave investors some peace of mind that higher debt costs wouldn't cut quite so much into riskier tech companies' bottom lines. But then Wall Street started selling off 10-year bonds, sending the yield higher to 1.65%, sending tech into reverse and pushing value stocks higher. Here's where major indexes stand now: The Dow surged 330 points, or 1% The S&P 500 rose 0.6% The Nasdaq was down 0.1%. Market volatility continues to creep lower, even as investors fret about seemingly everything: the pace of the recovery, rising bond yields, inflation, increasing Covid infections and a host of other concerns. The VIX volatility index fell below 20 again today (lower numbers indicate less volatility). On Monday, the Vix closed below 20 for the first time since February 2020, right before the pandemic took hold of Wall Street's attention.  Lower volatility doesn't necessarily mean smooth sailing for stocks: It's just one of a handful of data points included in CNN Business' Fear and Greed Index, which has fallen close to ""fear"" territory. But low volatility means stocks probably aren't going to go many sharp spikes or deep dives -- not for the moment, anyway. Worried about the Census Bureau's surprising report that manufacturing went into reverse in February? Don't be: America's manufacturing sector was plenty healthy in March. Markit's Manufacturing PMI index for March came in at 59 (anything over 50 indicates expansion). Although that was slightly below Wall Street's forecasts of 59.6, it's higher than February's 58.6.  Those numbers are confusing ！ but suffice it to say, 59 is plenty robust. Some investors were concerned that durable goods orders fell in February for the first time since April 2020 (see two posts below this one). But most were cautiously optimistic that February was a winter-weather-induced blip. Today's PMI report suggests that's probably the case. US stocks opened higher ahead of a second day of congressional testimony on the state of the economy from Janet Yellen and Jerome Powell at noon.  Investors continued to buy bonds, sending the 10-year yield lower for the fourth-straight day, to near 1.6%.  But stocks have seesawed lately as Wall Street tries to get its head around whether the economic recovery will take hold as strongly and quickly as previously believed as Covid cases continue to mount. Conversely, they¨re worried that the sugar rush from the stimulus will send prices higher, eating into corporate profits.  This morning, at least, investors were in a more optimistic mood. The Dow rose 140 points, or 0.4% The S&P 500 was up 0.4% The Nasdaq was also 0.4% higher America's manufacturing bounce-back has been steady as she goes since the pandemic sent the US economy into a nosedive a year ago.  That stopped in February, when US durable goods orders fell 1.1%, the Census Bureau reported this morning. That surprised Wall Street analysts, who had expected a 0.6% increase. Fear not, though: One weird month does not a trend make, and some historically awful winter weather (how you holdin' up, Texas?) made for a particularly challenging month for manufacturers.  Although America's economy firmly remains services-based, US manufacturing has rebounded over the past year as people buy more big-ticket goods, including cars (to the surprise of the auto industry), and shun services like travel and hospitality. There has been a surge in air travel with this year's spring break, but a recovery in flights by business travelers is much farther off, according to credit rating agency Moody's. ""Companies' duty of care to employees [will restrict] business trips in 2021,"" it said in a note Wednesday. ""Improving technology, company cost reductions and environmental concerns may put pressure on business travel. Around 10%-30% of business travel could be replaced by alternatives such as virtual meetings. As a result, business travel is unlikely to reach its 2019 level before 2024 at the earliest."" The note adds that some some forms of less-critical business travel may never fully recover. The note matches what numerous airline executives have been warning, that despite the pent-up demand for leisure travel, there will be a slow recovery for more lucrative business travel. And that will limit the airlines' revenue recovery, even if bookings are improving. The rebound in oil prices this year wasn't enough to stop credit rating agency Moody's from downgrading ExxonMobil. ""ExxonMobil's large increase in debt in 2020 and accompanying deterioration in financial leverage metrics following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic looks unlikely to be fully reversed in the next few years,"" said Pete Speer, Moody's senior vice president in the note that downgraded its rating to Aa2 from Aa1. ""The company is prioritizing debt reduction through capital spending restraint and free cash flow generation going forward, but by maintaining its large dividend the progress will be slow and subject to the uncertainties regarding commodity prices."" ExxonMobil, the nation's largest oil company, reported its first annual loss for 2020 since its 1999 merger of Exxon and Mobil. It had been one of the few companies with a perfect AAA credit rating until 2016, when it was downgraded for the first time in 67 years. Bitcoin?fans looking for ways to spend their?cryptocurrency fortunes?can add a big ticket item to the list: a Tesla. You can now buy a Tesla with?Bitcoin,"" CEO Elon Musk said in a?tweet?on Wednesday. Bitcoin paid to?Tesla?(TSLA)?will not be converted by the electric car company into regular currency, he added in a subsequent tweet. Musk said that the option to pay by bitcoin will be available outside the United States later this year. The price of a single bitcoin climbed nearly 3% to hit $56,242 shortly after Musk's tweet ！ more than enough to buy an entry level Tesla Model 3, which costs just under $40,000.  Read more here.

Blinken's show of unity with NATO and Europe shadowed by disagreement over gas pipeline,25/3/2021,"""The pipeline divides Europe, it exposes Ukraine and central Europe to Russian manipulation and coercion, it goes against Europe's own stated energy security goals, so what I said was that we will continue to monitor activity to complete and certify the pipeline, and if that activity takes place, we'll make a determination on the applicability of sanctions,"" Blinken said at a press conference in Brussels. 
The top US diplomat was in Brussels for meetings with NATO officials and European leaders in a diplomatic blitz to reaffirm the Biden administration's commitment to its allies; signal to Russia that any aggression will face a unified front, and consult on a slew of issues, including the pressing question of whether to pull US troops from Afghanistan by a May 1 deadline set by the last administration. 
Blinken also issued a call for unity in the face of an increasingly assertive China. ""There's no question that China's coercive behavior threatens our collective security and prosperity and that they are actively working to undercut the rules of the international system and the values we and our allies share,"" he said.
Later on Wednesday, Blinken and European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell announced the US and Europe will launch a dialogue on China at the senior official and expert levels on topics such as reciprocity, economic issues, resilience, human rights, security, multilateralism, and areas for constructive engagement with China, such as climate change. 
Borrell said that the two sides share an assessment of China's role ""as a partner, as a competitor and as a systemic rival,"" in remarks to reporters after a private meeting. Blinken said they were launching the dialogue ""because we know that we can approach Beijing most effectively when we're working together and coordinating our approaches.""
'On the same page'
Throughout his two-day visit, Blinken repeatedly emphasized the answer to these threats is for the US and Europe to work together more closely and stressed their unity on several issues, including the ongoing impasse with Iran. Blinken said the US and the so-called E3 -- the UK, France and Germany -- are ""very much on the same page when it comes to Iran.""
Washington has offered to hold talks with Iran about a US return to the 2015 agreement, but the two sides remain at an impasse, with Iran insisting that the US first lift sanctions and return to the deal it left in 2018, while Washington has pushed for mutually coordinated steps and for Iran to stop its steady violations of the pact.
""To date, Iran has chosen not to engage,"" Blinken said. ""So, as we've said, the ball is really in their court to see if they want to take the path to diplomacy and returning to compliance with the agreement."" 
""Let's see what happens in the weeks ahead,"" Blinken added.
On Afghanistan, Blinken said that Biden's upcoming decision on whether to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan by a May 1 deadline set by the previous administration will be informed by feedback from NATO allies.
""I relayed back the views that I heard yesterday from our allies to the President, and I think that's going to be an important factor in informing his thinking about the way forward,"" Blinken said. ""We went in together, we adjusted together, and, when the time is right, we will leave together."" Blinken said that Biden has noted ""it would be tough to meet the May 1 deadline for a full withdrawal, but whatever we end up doing again is going to be informed by the thinking of our allies, and tactical decisions aside, we're united with those allies.""
One discordant note
The sole discordant note in public was Nord Stream 2, a pipeline from Russian gas fields to Germany via the Baltic Sea that is currently under construction. It is intended to provide Europe with a sustainable gas supply while giving Russia more direct access to the European market. But as tensions between Russia and the West have risen due to Moscow's election interference in Europe and the US, its cyberattacks and ongoing occupation of Crimea, resistance to the pipeline has hardened in the US.
""President Biden has been very clear for a long time in his view that Nord Stream 2 is a bad idea,"" Blinken said, adding that he shared that view with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. ""I also made clear that firms engaged in pipeline construction risked US sanctions,"" Blinken said.
State Department officials have stressed that any entity involved in the Russia-Germany natural gas pipeline risks US sanctions and should immediately abandon work on the pipeline. Congress passed legislation in 2019, then expanded it in 2020, requiring sanctions. The legislation has significant support from a bipartisan Congressional majority.
Alliances
Blinken emphasized the importance of alliances and US-European unity in a speech later Wednesday, stressing the need for a united front against China, and tacitly acknowledged the strains on trans-Atlantic cooperation that developed during the Trump administration. 
""Some of our allies are wondering whether our commitment to their security is lasting,"" Blinken said. The answer, he said, is that ""the vast majority of the American people from both political parties support our alliances, even if they're divided along party lines on many other issues"" because ""we see our alliances, not as burdens, but as a way to get help from others in shaping a world that reflects our interests and our values."" 
Noting that the world looks very different than it did decades ago when alliances such as NATO were forged, Blinken said that since then, ""threats have multiplied. Competition has stiffened. Power dynamics have shifted. Trust in our alliances has been shaken -- trust in each other and trust in the strength of our commitments."" 
Blinken repeatedly stressed his central message of the Biden administration's respect and support for its traditional US allies, and how together, they can counter threats to democracy from the rise of increasingly autocratic leaders -- an issue in Turkey -- and from countries such as Russia and China.
""Across and even within our alliances, we don't always see eye to eye on the threats we face or how to confront them,"" Blinken said. ""Our shared values of democracy and human rights are being challenged -- not only from outside our countries, but from within."" 
Blinken also stressed that no major challenge facing the global community can be dealt with by any one country acting alone. ""New threats are outpacing our efforts to build the capabilities we need to contain them,"" he said.
""We can't just play defense -- we have to take an affirmative approach. We've seen how Beijing and Moscow are increasingly using access to critical resources, markets, and technologies to pressure our allies and drive wedges between us,"" Blinken said.
He stressed the dangers of economic coercion, a particular issue with China, saying ""we must not separate"" it from other forms of pressure and called for even more robust alliances to protect against threats. 
""Too often we put our alliances and partnerships into silos, we don't do enough to bring them together,"" Blinken said. Working in unison makes all countries stronger. ""We can't just play defense -- we must take an affirmative approach. We've seen how Beijing and Moscow are increasingly using access to critical resources, markets, and technologies to pressure our allies and drive wedges between us,"" Blinken said.
""When one of us is coerced, we should respond as allies, and work together to reduce our vulnerability, by ensuring our economies are more integrated with each other than they are with our principal competitors,"" Blinken added. 
Blinken said the US ""won't force our allies into an ""us-or-them"" choice with China"" and said countries can work with Beijing on issues like climate change and health security. ""We know that our allies have complex relationships with China that won't always align perfectly with ours, but we need to navigate these challenges together,"" he said. 
","Secretary of State Antony Blinken repeated his warning Wednesday that the US will consider sanctions if work on a gas pipeline between Russia and Germany is completed and certified -- a sole note of discord in an extended display of unity with European allies and NATO states.  ""The pipeline divides Europe, it exposes Ukraine and central Europe to Russian manipulation and coercion, it goes against Europe's own stated energy security goals, so what I said was that we will continue to monitor activity to complete and certify the pipeline, and if that activity takes place, we'll make a determination on the applicability of sanctions,"" Blinken said at a press conference in Brussels.  The top US diplomat was in Brussels for meetings with NATO officials and European leaders in a diplomatic blitz to reaffirm the Biden administration's commitment to its allies; signal to Russia that any aggression will face a unified front, and consult on a slew of issues, including the pressing question of whether to pull US troops from Afghanistan by a May 1 deadline set by the last administration.  Blinken also issued a call for unity in the face of an increasingly assertive China. ""There's no question that China's coercive behavior threatens our collective security and prosperity and that they are actively working to undercut the rules of the international system and the values we and our allies share,"" he said. Later on Wednesday, Blinken and European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell announced the US and Europe will launch a dialogue on China at the senior official and expert levels on topics such as reciprocity, economic issues, resilience, human rights, security, multilateralism, and areas for constructive engagement with China, such as climate change.  Borrell said that the two sides share an assessment of China's role ""as a partner, as a competitor and as a systemic rival,"" in remarks to reporters after a private meeting. Blinken said they were launching the dialogue ""because we know that we can approach Beijing most effectively when we're working together and coordinating our approaches."" 'On the same page' Throughout his two-day visit, Blinken repeatedly emphasized the answer to these threats is for the US and Europe to work together more closely and stressed their unity on several issues, including the ongoing impasse with Iran. Blinken said the US and the so-called E3 -- the UK, France and Germany -- are ""very much on the same page when it comes to Iran."" Washington has offered to hold talks with Iran about a US return to the 2015 agreement, but the two sides remain at an impasse, with Iran insisting that the US first lift sanctions and return to the deal it left in 2018, while Washington has pushed for mutually coordinated steps and for Iran to stop its steady violations of the pact. ""To date, Iran has chosen not to engage,"" Blinken said. ""So, as we've said, the ball is really in their court to see if they want to take the path to diplomacy and returning to compliance with the agreement.""  ""Let's see what happens in the weeks ahead,"" Blinken added. On Afghanistan, Blinken said that Biden's upcoming decision on whether to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan by a May 1 deadline set by the previous administration will be informed by feedback from NATO allies. ""I relayed back the views that I heard yesterday from our allies to the President, and I think that's going to be an important factor in informing his thinking about the way forward,"" Blinken said. ""We went in together, we adjusted together, and, when the time is right, we will leave together."" Blinken said that Biden has noted ""it would be tough to meet the May 1 deadline for a full withdrawal, but whatever we end up doing again is going to be informed by the thinking of our allies, and tactical decisions aside, we're united with those allies."" One discordant note The sole discordant note in public was Nord Stream 2, a pipeline from Russian gas fields to Germany via the Baltic Sea that is currently under construction. It is intended to provide Europe with a sustainable gas supply while giving Russia more direct access to the European market. But as tensions between Russia and the West have risen due to Moscow's election interference in Europe and the US, its cyberattacks and ongoing occupation of Crimea, resistance to the pipeline has hardened in the US. ""President Biden has been very clear for a long time in his view that Nord Stream 2 is a bad idea,"" Blinken said, adding that he shared that view with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. ""I also made clear that firms engaged in pipeline construction risked US sanctions,"" Blinken said. State Department officials have stressed that any entity involved in the Russia-Germany natural gas pipeline risks US sanctions and should immediately abandon work on the pipeline. Congress passed legislation in 2019, then expanded it in 2020, requiring sanctions. The legislation has significant support from a bipartisan Congressional majority. Alliances Blinken emphasized the importance of alliances and US-European unity in a speech later Wednesday, stressing the need for a united front against China, and tacitly acknowledged the strains on trans-Atlantic cooperation that developed during the Trump administration.  ""Some of our allies are wondering whether our commitment to their security is lasting,"" Blinken said. The answer, he said, is that ""the vast majority of the American people from both political parties support our alliances, even if they're divided along party lines on many other issues"" because ""we see our alliances, not as burdens, but as a way to get help from others in shaping a world that reflects our interests and our values.""  Noting that the world looks very different than it did decades ago when alliances such as NATO were forged, Blinken said that since then, ""threats have multiplied. Competition has stiffened. Power dynamics have shifted. Trust in our alliances has been shaken -- trust in each other and trust in the strength of our commitments.""  Blinken repeatedly stressed his central message of the Biden administration's respect and support for its traditional US allies, and how together, they can counter threats to democracy from the rise of increasingly autocratic leaders -- an issue in Turkey -- and from countries such as Russia and China. ""Across and even within our alliances, we don't always see eye to eye on the threats we face or how to confront them,"" Blinken said. ""Our shared values of democracy and human rights are being challenged -- not only from outside our countries, but from within.""  Blinken also stressed that no major challenge facing the global community can be dealt with by any one country acting alone. ""New threats are outpacing our efforts to build the capabilities we need to contain them,"" he said. ""We can't just play defense -- we have to take an affirmative approach. We've seen how Beijing and Moscow are increasingly using access to critical resources, markets, and technologies to pressure our allies and drive wedges between us,"" Blinken said. He stressed the dangers of economic coercion, a particular issue with China, saying ""we must not separate"" it from other forms of pressure and called for even more robust alliances to protect against threats.  ""Too often we put our alliances and partnerships into silos, we don't do enough to bring them together,"" Blinken said. Working in unison makes all countries stronger. ""We can't just play defense -- we must take an affirmative approach. We've seen how Beijing and Moscow are increasingly using access to critical resources, markets, and technologies to pressure our allies and drive wedges between us,"" Blinken said.

Elected leaders need to see through 'model minority' myth,24/3/2021,"In San Francisco, 75-year-old Xiao Zhen Xie and 83-year-old Ngoc Pham were punched and shoved while walking on Market Street, police said. In New York, the authorities are investigating five separate weekend incidents as potential hate crimes, including one where the victim said she was attacked after attending a rally supporting the Asian community.                                                                 
This type of indiscriminate violence against Asian communities is nothing new; it has a history drilled into me by my parents, who became a part of the first wave of Asian activists after the 1982 killing of Vincent Chin, a Chinese American man beaten to death by two White men in the Detroit metro area.  
But even while I know this history well, I am shocked and frustrated. In the earlier days of the pandemic, so many of our public and elected leaders failed to urgently recognize this growing wave of violence. As we collectively discuss what to do next, we have to look back. 
When Orange County's first local Covid-19 case was first announced in January 2020, I sent a message to a colleague also working in community engagement: ""I'm starting to notice an uptick in posts from people being weird about the AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islander) community. I think maybe we should do something?"" 
Social media platforms had transformed almost overnight into a hotbed of community fear and suspicion. Some posters tried to root out the identity and location of the patient, speculating wildly about the patient's alleged hospital, neighborhood, grocery stores and the restaurants the patient supposedly frequented. All of the posts ended with a similar warning: Please be aware and avoid these areas or areas frequented by ""mainland Chinese.""  
Of course, little of what was being said was true. But people of Asian descent were now increasingly being profiled -- as I was when I called for a Lyft about two weeks after the initial case announcement. 
The driver eyed me suspiciously in the rearview mirror, before asking if I was Chinese. Even when his face relaxed upon hearing my American accent (""... you're American Chinese and not Chinese Chinese!""), I couldn't help but keep an eye on the door handle as he drove. 
His casual chatter about how he was turning down all requests from anyone he felt was Asian and foreign (""Who knows if they have this virus, right?""), and his apparent lack of fear that I would react or report him, suggested to me that we were at some kind of social tipping point around the Asian community. 
So, I pushed for my professional colleagues in local and state organizations and governments to act. I proposed everything from trying to reach out to rideshare companies and working with them to educate drivers, to papering local Asian businesses with translated resources for reporting harassment and hate crimes. 
With each passing day, it felt more vital that we visibly do something. Not only was former President Donald Trump increasing his rhetoric about the ""China virus"" and ""Wuhan flu"", but there were also incidents and reactions increasing locally -- such as parents keeping kids out of schools over fears of Chinese students. To me, there was a clear and urgent need to show that the AAPI community was supported.   
But my recommendations were met with polite indifference and silence. Even a suggestion that we hold a public safety town hall for Asian families at a local school didn't get beyond the first email. A non-Asian community leader informed us we shouldn't make it an issue for the community unless it actually became an issue.   
""(The AAPI community) doesn't like to bring attention on themselves,"" the leader replied.  
The subtext felt clear. Because not enough people in Asian communities were visibly complaining to public leaders, because there weren't acts of physical violence to report to authorities, this wasn't considered a political priority. The uniformity of these responses also made me feel embarrassed -- like maybe I was misreading the room. I reluctantly stopped pushing for action.   
But after a year where nearly 3,800 crimes against Asian Americans were reported between March 19, 2020, to February 28, 2021 (representing a 150% annual increase), and now, after the shooting deaths of six Asian women in Atlanta, it's increasingly obvious I wasn't wrong. The Atlanta Police Department and FBI Director Christopher Wray have said it doesn't appear the crime was racially motivated, while Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told CNN, ""It looked like a hate crime to me."" 
Instead, it feels like the issue lies with our visibility, and how our public leaders have often chosen to perceive Asian discrimination. Captain Jay Baker of the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office said in a news conference that the alleged shooter described the day of the killings as a ""really bad day for him"" (Baker was later removed as spokesman for the case). Such statements help illustrate why it still feels as if so many leaders fail to understand Asian discrimination can seem invisible and occurs in atypical ways.  
From the idea of the model minority myth to the fact that Asian Americans are still a developing political force, to the understanding that Asian communities sometimes don't speak up in ways society seems to expect from communities in pain -- there are reasons for this invisibility, all meriting later discussion.  
But after a wasted year in which we experienced increasing grief and violence from Atlanta to the Bay Area, and after so many incidents of racism specifically experienced by AAPI women, our leaders have another chance to act now.  
There are certain practical actions for every legislator and community leader to take immediately, going beyond ceremonial resolutions and thoughts and prayers: 
They can learn from the AAPI community about the long, sad history of Asian discrimination and adjust their own baked-in biases. They can help increase funding to support bystander intervention training programs like Hollaback! to empower community members to act. So many of these incidents are occurring in broad daylight, with community members unsure how to respond. Proactive tools can help. They can hire diversely, so there are more staffers like me to identify and call out racism directed at the AAPI community. Staffers who understand the community, will also better understand meaningful action. 
By taking these steps, political leaders would be rising to the challenges of inoculating us against racism, much as they're already pushed to vaccinate us against Covid-19 itself.  
I encourage them to take this moment seriously and commit to actual change -- and not let this moment pass us.

A man drove through a crosswalk during a 'Stop Asian Hate' rally and authorities say they're investigating the incident as a hate crime,28/3/2021,"As?demonstrators marched through a crosswalk?in the city of Diamond Bar on Sunday to protest?racism?and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, a male suspect drove through a red light at the intersection yelling racist profanities at them, according to a news release from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. No one was reported injured.
The sheriff's office described the suspect as a White man in his 50s and said his license plate was captured on video.
""Based on what we have learned, this is being investigated as a hate crime,"" L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said in a statement.
In a video of the incident taken by a witness and shared with CNN, a black vehicle is seen making a U-turn through the group of protesters in the crosswalk while the driver yells, ""F**k China"" and N***er. Another video taken by that witness shows the man yelling similar profanities while his vehicle was pulled over by a sidewalk.
The sheriff's department said it didn't have any further information on the investigation to share at this time.
Demonstrators in cities across the country gathered over the weekend to protest hate and violence against Asian Americans and grieve for those killed at three spas in Georgia last week.
Community leaders say the Georgia shootings have exacerbated the fears of many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, as crime and racist rhetoric against them have surged during the coronavirus pandemic.
Anti-Asian hate crimes more than doubled last year in 16 of the nation's largest cities, according to an analysis of preliminary data by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. 
Meanwhile, advocacy groups such as Stop AAPI Hate and Asian Americans Advancing Justice-AAJC have cataloged thousands of incidents of hate and discrimination against the AAPI community.

Elizabeth Warren grills Janet Yellen: Why isn't BlackRock 'too big to fail?',24/3/2021,"At a hearing held by the Senate Banking Committee, Warren noted that the Federal Reserve began designating very large banks as ""too-big-to-fail,"" giving them stronger oversight granted by Congress in the Dodd-Frank act. That bill, drafted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a regulator that can give special scrutiny to banks deemed systemically important -- at the time, those with more than $50 billion in assets.
So why isn't BlackRock (BLK), which oversees 180 times that amount of assets, designated too big to fail?
""If a $9 trillion investment company failed would that likely have a significant impact on our economy?"" Warren asked Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.
Yellen said she believes it's less important to designate a particular company and more important to scrutinize the actions they take. For example, in 2016 and 2017 the FSOC investigated the potential damage caused by massive withdrawals at open-end mutual funds, which forced asset managers to sell off assets, creating fire sales. That very thing happened in March 2020.
""With respect to asset management, rather than focus on designation of companies, I think it's important to focus on an activity like that and consider what the appropriate restrictions are,"" Yellen said. ""It's not obvious to me that designation is the appropriate tool.""
Warren was having none of that. Isn't the designation itself what gives the Fed oversight, she shot back? And since BlackRock isn't designated, it doesn't have that additional scrutiny, she noted. 
'BlackRock is not a bank'
BlackRock, in response, noted that the money it manages doesn't belong to the company ！ and two-thirds of its managed assets are slated for retirement savings.
The company said, however, that it does support regulatory reform.
""Well-functioning capital markets are critical to building a resilient economy that allows more people to experience financial well-being,"" the company said in a statement. ""We support financial regulatory reform that increases transparency, protects investors and facilitates responsible growth.""
BlackRock noted that regulators around the world have investigated the asset management industry, concluding that they should be regulated differently from banks.
""BlackRock is not a bank, and as an asset manager, we are a heavily regulated company,"" it said.
Yet Yellen conceded that she thinks ""it's appropriate to designate institutions whose failure would pose a material risk to US financial stability.""
So then Warren wanted to know why wouldn't a $9 trillion institution like BlackRock pose a risk if it failed? 
Yellen answered only that the FSOC had investigated BlackRock in the past and will continue to do so in the future. 
Warren, none too happy with that response, called for more immediate action.
""When the party is going strong, it's the job of the regulators to take away the punchbowl,"" she said. ""My view on this is Congress gave you the tools to monitor the risk and it is important to use them.""
","Senator Elizabeth Warren wants to know why the Biden administration isn't more concerned that BlackRock manages $9 trillion in assets -- more than the annual GDP of any country not named the United States or China.

Travel to Singapore during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go,24/3/2021,,"If you're planning to travel to Singapore, here's what you'll need to know and expect if you want to visit during the Covid-19 pandemic. The basics Singapore has done a superb job of minimizing Covid-19. Its lockdown measures ended in June and it has since implemented strict controls to limit the spread of the virus. Most foreign travelers are not permitted entry. Be aware that Singapore takes its rules very seriously and is not afraid to enforce them.  In February, a man who violated his hotel quarantine in order to spend time with his fiancee was sentenced to two weeks in jail. Meanwhile, a 65-year-old woman who was meeting with a male friend didn't disclose her check-ins with him on the TraceTogether app due to fears her husband would think she was having an affair. Her inconsistencies were detected by CCTV and parking records after she tested positive for Covid-19 and she has been ordered to spend five months behind bars.   Quarantine violations carry a penalty of a fine of up to S$10,000 ($7,565) or up to six months in jail, or both. What's on offer The quintessential modern Asian city, Singapore's glittering skyscrapers and waterside setting make it easy to love. Throw in some of the world's best street food, served in its ubiquitous hawker centers, and the lush rainforest of Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, and the city-state has more than enough to satisfy fascinated tourists. Who can go Currently, entry is largely limited to Singapore citizens and permanent residents. Short term tourist visits from Australia, Brunei, Mainland China, New Zealand, Taiwan and Vietnam are now allowed, subject to securing an Air Travel Pass and taking a PCR test on arrival. Business travelers from these countries, as well as Indonesia and Japan can also enter under the Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL) scheme, but are subject to tight restrictions. Until February 1, travelers from Germany, Malaysia and South Korea were part of the RGL program. Following upticks in cases in those three countries, Singapore has indefinitely suspended the green lanes with them for at least three months. Visitors who have already been approved to use the RGL will still be able to travel back and forth as long as they test negative, but no new applications will be accepted. The World Economic Forum, due to be held in the Lion City in May, has been postponed to August 17-20.  Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung says he expects the country to reopen through a slow, four-pronged approach by the end of 2021. One of the prongs will be waiving or greatly reducing quarantine restrictions for travelers with proof of vaccination. Another is expanding the list of countries and territories whose citizens can be cleared to visit unilaterally.  Singapore currently has capacity to conduct 60,000 quick Covid tests per day. What are the restrictions? Singapore nationals and permanent residents are allowed to enter, but must have proof of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure and spend 14 days in quarantine after being served a stay-home notice (SHN) on arrival. This can be undertaken in a dedicated SHN facility, or at their place of residence. However, those who opt for the latter must wear an electronic monitoring device for 14 days and will be subject to checks, including random visits, calls and text messages. Details including ID card or passport number must be shared in order to confirm identity. A further PCR test must be taken and come back negative before being allowed out into the community. Those traveling from countries with an Air Travel Pass agreement must apply for entry here between seven and 30 days before departure and submit health details and all travel movements over the previous 14 days via a SGArrivalCard. They must also download the Trace Together app to their mobile device and pay for an on-arrival PCR test, at a cost of SGD$196 (US $148). This applies to all travelers aged six and over. Passengers must also secure non-residential accommodation for 48 hours while awaiting their results.  As of January 24, anyone entering Singapore for any reason will get a rapid Covid-19 test upon arriving at the airport. And as of January 31, all travelers will have to prove they have travel insurance that can cover at least $30,000 in expenses if necessary. Business travelers using the Reciprocal Green Lane and working for Singapore-based companies are subject to the same rules and must be staying at a non-residential address. They must also give authorities an itinerary for the entire length of their stay. Due to concern about the coronavirus variant, travelers from the UK or South Africa now have to quarantine for 21 days. However, they can split this up, spending the first two weeks in a government-approved facility and the last week at home.  The much-awaited Connect@Changi, a purpose-built bubble facility built at Changi Airport's Expo Hall, opened on February 19. The unique space provides places for people to meet in socially distanced pods and is intended as a way for high-value business travelers to come to the country safely, without leaving the airport for the duration of their stay. Layover passengers are permitted in specific areas of the airport. They are not allowed to leave these designated areas unless they have a confirmed booking for one of Changi's two airport hotels, and if going there they must be accompanied by an airport staff member. What's the Covid situation? Covid has been largely suppressed in the community. Singapore has had 60,196 cases and just 30 deaths from coronavirus as of March 16. New cases are largely confined to quarantine facilities.  The city-state began rolling out Covid vaccines from Pfizer on January 13. What can visitors expect?

Travel to Japan during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go,24/3/2021,,"If you're planning to travel to Japan, here's what you'll need to know and expect if you want to visit during the Covid-19 pandemic. The basics Japan was lauded for containing the virus during the first wave but has seen a surge in cases, with a major spike in November and December.  As of March 22, Japan has reported 456,318 confirmed cases of the virus and 8,821 deaths.  Four prefectures -- Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba -- ended their emergency declarations on March 21. They were the last four prefectures to be under these declarations and re-opened about a week ahead of schedule.  Prime Minister Suga announced on February 9 that all foreign nationals would be barred from entering the country, but did not specify a start date or give details about how this would be implemented. While the Tokyo Olympics are still scheduled to take place in 2021, Reuters reports that it is highly likely that foreign residents would be barred from attending or being in the audience. The IOC and Japanese government will make an official announcement on the matter in early March.  Although all foreign nationals have been barred from attending the Olympics in summer 2021 and are mostly unable to enter the country, Japanese authorities announced that they are considering testing any foreigner entering the country for the newer coronavirus variants.  What's on offer A heady mix of the cutting edge and deeply traditional, Japan remains a major draw for travelers from all over the globe. Whether participating in a traditional tea ceremony in Kyoto, scouring Tokyo's Akihabara district for tech bargains or soaking in a hot onsen in the forests of Tohoku, this is a country that leaves its mark on all who visit. Who can go Japan has some of the most stringent travel restrictions in the world, with 152 countries on its prohibited list. Visitors from Australia, Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam may enter the country, although those traveling from China and South Korea can only arrive into the country via Tokyo Narita airport. Additionally, those traveling for study, work or to join family (subject to visa requirements) may enter.  Prime Minister Suga announced on January 14 that the borders would close to all foreign nationals, although there were no specifics on beginning and ending dates. He also did not specify whether this would apply to foreign citizens with Japanese residency. What are the restrictions? Travelers from permitted destinations must undertake a 14-day quarantine, although it is possible to request a PCR test on arrival. A negative result allows you to finish quarantine.  Those traveling under Japan's revised business travel rules will need to provide proof of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of departure, signed and stamped by the laboratory where it was taken. While they will not need to self-isolate, they will need to provide details of their movements for the following two weeks and not use public transport. What's the Covid situation? After low infection rates in the first wave, Japan has seen a sharp increase in cases. The Japanese government's 'Go To Travel' scheme, which subsidized domestic tourism in a bid to boost the economy, has been blamed by some for the rise in positive infections. Tokyo has been particularly hard hit. The capital recorded 2,447 cases on January 7, the single highest per-day number since the start of the pandemic. Since then, the daily infection rate has remained in the four figures daily.  The huge question of whether the Olympics will go on as intended remains unanswered. Japan is determined to host the events despite the ongoing virus situation. Several options have been floated, including having all athletes inside a ""bubble"" and not permitting any spectators to attend.  The vaccine rollout has been slow compared to others in Asia due to a shortage of medical professionals and a lack of syringes. As of March 8, only 46,500 vaccines had been administered, nearly all to health care workers.  What can visitors expect? While much of Japan remains open for business, cities are far quieter than usual and the government has the right to request the closure of businesses in areas of high transmission. Masks must be worn in public. Useful links Ministry of Foreign Affairs Japan Tourist Board Our latest coverage There's so much to see in Japan. Osaka is now home to the world's first -- and so far only -- Super Nintendo World, where visitors can put on virtual reality glasses and play a real-life version of Mario Kart. Fukushima is ready for tourists again, while you can practice shirin yoku, or forest bathing, in Kyoto's Sagano Bamboo Forest. For something a little less idyllic, there's a museum dedicated to poop in Yokohama.

Traveling to Spain during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go,24/3/2021,,"If you're planning to travel to Spain, here's what you'll need to know and expect if you want to visit during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The basics Spain has suffered greatly from Covid-19, with a high number of cases and deaths. After one of Europe's strictest lockdowns in spring 2020, it reopened to visitors over the summer, but has since entered a state of emergency that is due to run until May 2021. What's on offer One of Europe's biggest hitters for good reason, Spain pulls tourists in by the millions thanks to its warm weather, laidback vibe and excellent food and wine. Plus, of course, there are some of Europe's best beach resorts, mountains, and cultural cities such as Madrid, Seville and Barcelona. Who can go Travelers from most places in the European Union, alongside Australia, China, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, Thailand and Uruguay are allowed to enter Spain without having to undergo quarantine.  However, arrivals from the UK are restricted until March 30, 2021, except for Spanish nationals and legal residents of Spain.  The ban on UK arrivals has been extended several times, but is due to be lifted March 30. However UK regulations forbid British people from traveling abroad for vacations until at least May 17. British travelers can travel to Spain in order to buy or rent a second home, or prepare a second home for move in, which is deemed ""a reasonable excuse."" Brazil and South Africa arrivals are restricted until at least April 13. The border has also been restricted between Spain and Portugal. Visitors from other countries are not permitted to enter, unless they gain special permission from the Spanish government. What are the restrictions? All travelers must complete a Health Control Form (HCF), which can be completed via the Spain Travel Health website or app. It will generate a QR code which must be shown on arrival in the country. Travelers arriving from 'risk' countries, based on guidelines from the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) for essential reasons must also undertake a PCR test within 72 hours of departure and show proof of a negative result on entry. This list of countries changes regularly and should be checked before travel.  Health assessments take place on arrival into Spain, with a temperature check and visual examination as standard. Spain's health minister also announced that travelers arriving from Brazil and South Africa are being given an antigen test in the airport. Additionally, all travelers to the Canary Islands, no matter where they're arriving from, require an antigen test taken within 72 hours of departure in order to check into their accommodation. What's the Covid situation? Spain has been in a state of emergency since the start of November 2020, with curbs due to be in place until May 2021. It has seen over 3 million infections and over 73,000 deaths. On February 8, Spain recorded the biggest weekend rise in cases since the pandemic began. January 2021 was reportedly the worst month for the pandemic in Spain since the summer, and on February 8, Spain recorded the biggest weekend rise in cases since the pandemic began. Case rates now appear to be falling. On March 8, Spain reported the lowest weekend rise in cases since July last year, but authorities still urge caution amid fears of a third wave hitting Europe. Over 6.4 million people have had their first vaccination in Spain as of March 24. What can visitors expect? Under the state of emergency, a national curfew is in place, effective from 11 p.m. until 6 a.m. Masks must be worn in public at all times (children 5 and younger are exempt), while gatherings indoors and outdoors are limited to six people. Restrictions vary by region, with some closing their internal borders to prevent transmission of Covid-19. This regional approach means that restrictions often change depending on the local government. Curfew times may change as a result. Hotels are operating at limited capacity, limiting guest numbers to ensure social distancing. Smoking outdoors is banned where two meters' social distancing cannot be maintained.

Republicans and Democrats have found one thing they can all rally around: Curbing China's influence,24/3/2021,"With the looming partisan brawl over a Biden's next major agenda item, an infrastructure proposal that will carry a price tag between $3 trillion and $4 trillion, Democrats hope that a significant bipartisan agreement to confront China on multiple fronts could help the Biden administration restore fractured relationships with Republicans in Congress who felt slighted by the Democrats' rapid pursuit of a Coronavirus relief in the first days of Biden's presidency. 
There are discussions underway between Republicans and the White House and across multiple Senate committees as the legislative package is being crafted, which could cover everything from boosting technology funding for semiconductors and bolstering the US supply chain to confronting China on intellectual property theft and the repression of Uyghur Muslims. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday he wants to have the bill on the Senate floor in April after the Senate returns from the Easter recess.
Republicans say they also see China legislation as ripe for a bipartisan agreement -- and to restore some good will with the Biden White House. The Biden administration also earned some early confidence of congressional Republicans when Biden's top national security officials stood up to Chinese aggressions during last week's diplomatic clash with Chinese officials.
""It is hard to undo a $1.9 trillion package that involved zero consultation with Republicans, but I do think this could help right the course. It is going to take a pattern or nonpartisan on bipartisan behavior to reset things,"" Sen. Todd Young, a Republican from Indiana. 
The feeling is mutual inside the White House, according to administration officials. The active engagement on the legislation has been high-level, regular and with the goal of reaching a bipartisan deal with the very Republicans who attacked Biden for failing to follow through on his push for bipartisanship. While there's an acknowledgement that a final deal isn't a sure thing, ""we see an outcome here and we want an outcome here,"" a senior administration official told CNN. 
For weeks, Young has been talking regularly with the White House's legislative affairs team in an effort to settle on language that could win not just a handful of Republican votes but dozens, and GOP leaders have strategized with their chairmen about the best way to pursue the negotiations with Democrats on China.
There's still a long way to go. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said China was ripe for a bipartisan agreement in a Senate floor speech, but he also warned Democrats the bill should not become a liberal wish list and argued that increased defense spending -- not likely to be part of this package -- was a ""crucial first step"" to confronting China.
""The Democratic majority must resist the temptation to pile a long list of unrelated policy wishes into a big package and try to label it 'China policy,'"" McConnell said. ""It would be quite a remarkable coincidence if our Democratic colleagues' vision for a so-called China bill ends up indistinguishable from a list of things that just happen to delight liberal interest groups.""
Realities of a polarized Washington 
McConnell's comments are reflection of the fact that the effort to China hits on a wide swath of US policy, from technology to national security to human rights, but also issues that remain contentious on Capitol Hill, like immigration, that could threaten to scuttle the bill.
The legislation could also attract opposition from China hawks in the Republican Party mulling potential 2024 presidential bids who are unlikely to want to give Biden a win on confronting China.
""We have Republicans already who are going to be running in terms of foreign policy on the China issue. They've had already a scorched-earth approach on this,"" said Jude Blanchette, the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""You've seen them come out already going after Biden for appeasement and being soft on China. That to me is a harbinger of more politics as usual settling in here.""
White House officials say they are aware the early bipartisanship may eventually fall apart -- the realities of a polarized Washington aren't easily overcome. It's led some in the administration to eye the infrastructure package as a possible landing place for the legislative push if it fails to move on a standalone basis, officials said.

Still, there's optimism on both sides of the aisle that an agreement can be found on the fringes in areas that deal less directly with US foreign policy and more with a commitment to protecting economic development on US shores. Democrats and Republicans agree there's a need for Congress to address China on multiple fronts, and they largely back the notion of addressing the issue with wide-ranging legislation.
""There's a lot of good will, there's a lot of common ground,"" said Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat.
Asked if the China legislation was a chance for the Biden administration to notch a bipartisan win, Booker said, ""I can't speak to the strategy. I'm just trying to get things done.""
'I feel good about the process'
The China effort underscores one of the most enduring challenges for the administration and for Democrats in the months ahead: deciding how to best utilize their Democratic majorities in the limited time they have. Liberals are pushing the Biden White House and the Senate to blow up the filibuster and address numerous issues, including immigration, voting rights, climate change and gun control.
With a $3 trillion infrastructure package on the table, Democrats have the tools to push another massive policy bill through with solely Democratic votes through reconciliation, the same tool used to pass the $1.9 trillion Covid relief package. But despite the urging of some progressives to plow ahead quickly and without Republican buy in, moderates have pushed back and demanded more time and consideration to try and find a way ahead with Republicans on infrastructure and to some extent immigration. 
Democratic members say the Biden administration is practicing patience and restraint in the wake of the Covid relief bill, an effort to let Democratic differences play out and give lawmakers on Capitol Hill more time to settle on a cohesive strategy. In the interim, it's given the Biden administration a chance to pursue bipartisanship on China. 
""They have a lot of different things going on,"" Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia said of Biden's agenda. ""I do think a right strategy with respect to China and infrastructure are the two big priorities now as well as implementing what we just did."" 
The base of the Senate's China bill comes from legislation Schumer and Young introduced together last year. Young told CNN that he has been happy with the White House's efforts so far on the broader China package, though he added he isn't afraid to walk away from the negotiations if he begins to feel like he and his GOP colleagues can't back the final bill. 
""I feel good about the process because we are going to go through regular order, introduce the bill in the Senate, refer it to committees and then in a bipartisan fashion, the process will work its way out,"" Young said. ""I want (the administration) to be invested in earning 70, 80, 90 votes in the US Senate. If they are merely invested in the 60-vote work product that will be disappointing to me. ... The goal should be to find something that is broadly appealing.""
'The devil is in the details'
The package under consideration could include a number of elements from Democratic and Republican bills that deal with everything from pushing alternatives to China's Huawei 5G technology and protecting US intellectual property to potentially dealing with some of the human rights violations in China. But the foundation of the package is the legislation introduced last year by Schumer and Young that would make investments in broadening the mission of the National Science Foundation to keep the US competitive in the technological and science fields. 
The bill would give a more than $100 billion science and technology investments to help the US stay competitive and would designate 10 regional hubs that would be selected to help lead research. 
Schumer directed the committees last month to begin preparing for the legislation. The goal is to finish language for the initial package in the days and weeks ahead so that committees can return from the Easter recess ready to mark up the bill and get it to the floor by the end of April. 
There are already some bipartisan efforts that can be added, like a bill to bring back semiconductor production to the US. In some cases, like the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, there were China bills introduced last year by both the committee's top Democrat, Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, and top Republican, Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho. Risch reintroduced his bill this session.
Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, told CNN it's been a ""very consultative and positive process"" as the Foreign Relations panel and multiple additional committees have been piecing together proposals to be debated in committee and added to the bill that goes to the Senate floor.
Coons said the task for Senate leaders will be deciding how robust the package can be while maintaining wide support in the Senate.
""It's also reasonable to ask how broad is the scope?"" Coons said. ""Are we really talking about things that are specific to American renewal, reinvesting in our country, innovation, manufacturing, things that make us more competitive? Are we looking at things that are very specifically in response to China?""
Blanchette said that the bipartisan desire to confront China doesn't always mean there's a bipartisan solution. On immigration. for instance, Democrats favor expanding high-skilled work visas to attract foreign talent to compete with China, while GOP China hawks have looked to limit students from China at US universities, arguing there are national security concerns. 
""There's a lot of bipartisan agreement on exactly what the China challenge is, the fronts on which there are risks that need to be tackled,"" said Anna Ashton, the vice president of government affairs at the US-China Business Council, a trade group that represents US business interests in China.
""A lot of this stuff the devil is in the details,"" Ashton added. ""I think it actually is going to be quite complicated to figure out how to roll out policy solutions that actually protect what they want to protect, bolster what they want to bolster, and do more good than harm.""
","A bipartisan group of senators is pushing to pass legislation as soon as next month to try to rein in China's economic influence on the United States, in an effort that represents President Joe Biden's best chance at a major bipartisan package from Congress. With the looming partisan brawl over a Biden's next major agenda item, an infrastructure proposal that will carry a price tag between $3 trillion and $4 trillion, Democrats hope that a significant bipartisan agreement to confront China on multiple fronts could help the Biden administration restore fractured relationships with Republicans in Congress who felt slighted by the Democrats' rapid pursuit of a Coronavirus relief in the first days of Biden's presidency.

Tencent's profits are soaring. But investors are worried about a crackdown by China,24/3/2021,"The Chinese tech giant beat estimates Wednesday with earnings for the quarter ended December. Revenue surged 26% to 133.7 billion yuan ($20.5 billion), while profit climbed as much as 175% to 59 billion yuan ($9 billion) compared to the same time the previous year. 
""While 2020 was a year of unprecedented challenges, solid results across all our businesses testify to our focus on user value, technology innovation and business sustainability,"" Tencent (TCEHY) Chairman and CEO Ma Huateng, who is also known as Pony Ma, said in a statement. 
But there's a risk that the results will be overshadowed by concerns of a growing government crackdown on Chinese tech companies. 
Earlier on Wednesday, Tencent's stock dropped about 1.5% in Hong Kong after Reuters reported that Ma had recently met with antitrust officials. Shares later pulled back to close down slightly.

According to Reuters, which cited three unidentified sources, the meeting was requested by Tencent, and took place earlier this month with China's competition watchdog, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR). 
In a statement Wednesday, Tencent stressed that the gathering ""was a voluntary meeting."" 
""Tencent has had meetings with regulators on a regular basis, and this was a regular meeting,"" it said. ""We discussed a broad range of topics, mainly focused on fostering innovation and creating a healthy environment for industry evolution. Tencent has always and will continue to conduct our operations in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.""
SAMR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
According to two sources who spoke to Reuters, Chinese officials are looking into potential monopolistic practices by WeChat, Tencent's popular social networking app. Regulators are specifically concerned that the platform may have ""squashed fair competition and squeezed smaller rivals,"" the news agency reported. 

Aside from its ownership of WeChat, Tencent is known for its dominance in online payments in the country through its WeChat Pay platform, as well as its popular mobile games.
But scrutiny of the firm has soared recently, particularly after the treatment of China's other top tech giant, Alibaba (BABA). 
Late last year, Alibaba's financial technology affiliate, Ant Group, was forced to shelve a record-breaking $37 billion IPO after co-founder Jack Ma landed in hot water with regulators. 
Ant, which owns another popular digital payments app, Alipay, has huge interests in online investing, insurance and consumer lending, and has since been ordered to overhaul its business.
Regulators are now said to be considering requiring Tencent to restructure its fintech arm, Bloomberg News has reported, citing unnamed sources. Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.
Martin Lau, Tencent's president, said on a call with Wall Street analysts Wednesday that the company didn't push the boundaries of China's regulations.
""We are very self-restrained in terms of monetization and our business practices,"" Lau said. ""I think we sometimes get a criticism on being too much in self-control. But that's something that we'll continue to do, and we think it's going to be beneficial for us in the current environment.""

","Tencent just posted a huge jump in profits, but that won't stop investors from fretting over whether it'll become the next big target of a clampdown by regulators on tech companies in China. The Chinese tech giant beat estimates Wednesday with earnings for the quarter ended December. Revenue surged 26% to 133.7 billion yuan ($20.5 billion), while profit climbed as much as 175% to 59 billion yuan ($9 billion) compared to the same time the previous year.  ""While 2020 was a year of unprecedented challenges, solid results across all our businesses testify to our focus on user value, technology innovation and business sustainability,"" Tencent Chairman and CEO Ma Huateng, who is also known as Pony Ma, said in a statement.  But there's a risk that the results will be overshadowed by concerns of a growing government crackdown on Chinese tech companies.  Earlier on Wednesday, Tencent's stock dropped about 1.5% in Hong Kong after Reuters reported that Ma had recently met with antitrust officials. Shares later pulled back to close down slightly. According to Reuters, which cited three unidentified sources, the meeting was requested by Tencent, and took place earlier this month with China's competition watchdog, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR).  In a statement Wednesday, Tencent stressed that the gathering ""was a voluntary meeting.""  ""Tencent has had meetings with regulators on a regular basis, and this was a regular meeting,"" it said. ""We discussed a broad range of topics, mainly focused on fostering innovation and creating a healthy environment for industry evolution. Tencent has always and will continue to conduct our operations in compliance with relevant laws and regulations."" SAMR did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to two sources who spoke to Reuters, Chinese officials are looking into potential monopolistic practices by WeChat, Tencent's popular social networking app. Regulators are specifically concerned that the platform may have ""squashed fair competition and squeezed smaller rivals,"" the news agency reported.  Aside from its ownership of WeChat, Tencent is known for its dominance in online payments in the country through its WeChat Pay platform, as well as its popular mobile games. But scrutiny of the firm has soared recently, particularly after the treatment of China's other top tech giant, Alibaba.  Late last year, Alibaba's financial technology affiliate, Ant Group, was forced to shelve a record-breaking $37 billion IPO after co-founder Jack Ma landed in hot water with regulators.  Ant, which owns another popular digital payments app, Alipay, has huge interests in online investing, insurance and consumer lending, and has since been ordered to overhaul its business. Regulators are now said to be considering requiring Tencent to restructure its fintech arm, Bloomberg News has reported, citing unnamed sources. Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter. Martin Lau, Tencent's president, said on a call with Wall Street analysts Wednesday that the company didn't push the boundaries of China's regulations. ""We are very self-restrained in terms of monetization and our business practices,"" Lau said. ""I think we sometimes get a criticism on being too much in self-control. But that's something that we'll continue to do, and we think it's going to be beneficial for us in the current environment."" ！ CNN's Beijing bureau and Laura He contributed to this report.",tech,BUSINESS
Boris Johnson's latest gaffe could threaten Britain's vaccine rollout,24/3/2021,"During the weekly ""1922 Committee"" meeting of Conservative backbenchers, Johnson made an unguarded comment in which he claimed that the UK's successful vaccine rollout was ""because of capitalism, because of greed, my friends,"" multiple sources who were on the call have confirmed to CNN.
Realizing how controversial his comments could be if made public, Johnson then retracted them almost immediately, according to the sources, saying ""actually I regret saying it ... forget I said that.""
Johnson's spokespeople have declined to provide CNN with a comment on the matter. 
A spokesperson for the opposition Labour party told CNN: ""The idea that acts of selfishness ... have got us through this crisis seems very odd: It's hard to work out where the Prime Minister is coming from there.""

The timing of these comments could be troubling for the Prime Minister, as the European Commission prepares to lay out its plans for tougher export controls on Covid-19 vaccines produced within the bloc.
Brussels' vaccine plan has been hindered by supply and distribution problems.
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is expected to target companies within the EU that the Commission believes are not honoring the contracts signed with Brussels when it negotiated deals for vaccines on behalf of the 27 member states.
The plans are also expected to include new powers allowing the EU to withhold deliveries to countries that do not reciprocally export vaccines back to the EU. 
Leaders from the EU's 27 member states will meet virtually on Thursday to discuss the Commission's recommendations.
Leaders from Germany and Ireland have already urged caution over export measures that would target countries.
The UK, which opted not to take part in the EU's vaccine strategy, has been rolling out its program to immunize citizens notably faster than the rest of the continent. Domestically, this has been framed by many as an upshot of Brexit and an example of what can be done now the country is free of the EU's bureaucratic yoke.

The European Medicines Agency has been criticized for being slow to approve vaccines, so other EU nations have turned to Russia and China to plug the gaps in vaccine supply through unilateral procurement deals. 
The UK's relative success has been embarrassing for the EU. Any complaints that the UK is not playing fairly or suggestions of retroactive measures are easy to frame as petulance from Brussels, an attempt to blame others for its own failures. 
However, Johnson's greed comments could prove useful for a Commission trying to unite member states and paint the UK as the bad guy.
Which raises the key question: Why did Johnson say this?
Those present at the meeting have offered up theories that the Prime Minister was ""clearly joking"" to a room of friends, as he'd spent the whole meeting ""praising AstraZeneca for not seeking profit,"" to suggestions he was ""speaking in a typical Boris rambly way"" and stumbled into discussing how the left-wing opposition Labour party opposes any private investment in the National Health Service.
""He was talking off the cuff, I think, then suddenly remembered he was Prime Minister,"" one lawmaker present at the meeting told CNN.
There is no denying, though, that the timing of his remarks is poor. 
The vaccine rollout has been a rare success in Johnson's response to the pandemic. 
The UK still has the highest death toll from coronavirus in Europe. 
Anything that dents the vaccination program and delays his plans to take Britons out of lockdown could severely damage the Prime Minister and his government at a time they can ill afford a serious knock -- least of all one delivered by the European Union.

Biden's heartfelt plea for gun control adds to daunting policy wish list,24/3/2021,"The President has already passed a $1.9 trillion Covid rescue plan that reflects the reality that his administration will be mostly defined by his ability to conquer the pandemic that has killed more than half a million Americans. What comes next could be even bigger, as CNN reported on Monday that the White House is already preparing a $3 trillion jobs and infrastructure proposal, the Democratic-led House has sent the Senate a massive election bill and the President also envisages big climate change legislation.
Biden eulogized the victims of the mass shooting at a Boulder, Colorado, supermarket at the White House on Tuesday at a hastily arranged event, and took the chance to add more to his administration's already-full plate.
""I don't need to wait another minute, let alone an hour, to take common-sense steps that will save the lives in the future, and to urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to act,"" Biden said.
""We can ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country once again. I got that done when I was a senator. It passed. It was the law for the longest time. And it brought down these mass killings. We should do it again.""
The remarks before Biden headed off to Ohio to tout his Covid rescue plan and mark Obamacare's 11th anniversary reflected the sudden crises that erupt and can disrupt the best-laid plans of any President.
The mass shooting in Colorado -- the seventh in seven days in the United States, by CNN's count -- came while his administration struggles to control a flood of child migrants at the border, which his team won't call a crisis, amid a foreign policy showdown between Biden and two major nuclear powers, Russia and China.

But White House senior adviser Cedric Richmond told CNN on Tuesday night that the President would seek to mobilize public opinion to change the political dynamics in Washington.
""I think that the will of the people ... they will create the demand. We will help lead that and we will help to pass it,"" Richmond told CNN's Pamela Brown on ""The Situation Room.""
""The President feels very strongly that he is not going to sit back and watch people get mowed down in the streets without trying.""
No change on Biden's filibuster stance 
Biden later told reporters that he hadn't started counting votes in the Senate when he was asked about the daunting prospects for gun control legislation. 
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said later that the President's opposition to abolishing the filibuster -- a procedural rule requiring a 60-vote majority to pass legislation in the Senate, which had scuppered previous efforts on firearms -- had not changed in light of the new guns debate.
""He believes that we should work with Democrats and Republicans to get work done for the American people, including common-sense gun safety measures,"" Psaki said. Biden would not allow obstruction to thwart his work for Americans, she vowed, but added: ""His preference and priority is working with members of both parties.""
Such a position, however, almost guarantees that the latest shooting -- along with last week's massacre in Georgia, which killed eight people at Asian-owned spas -- will not produce meaningful new laws, given GOP opposition.
And it's not even clear that Biden can get the entire Democratic caucus on board. The most moderate member, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, said Tuesday that the House-passed bills on firearms went too far. 
While gun control groups detect a shift in opposition to new curbs on dangerous weapons in many states and in local political races, there's little sign of a significant shift in the Washington dynamic. Manchin was a key player in a previous effort to pass moderately tightened background checks into law in 2013 in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre, which killed 20 elementary schoolers and six adults in Connecticut. But the limited compromise Manchin brokered with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania didn't survive the GOP filibuster in a drama Biden watched take place as vice president.
Given the obstacles to passing new firearms laws, the most that progressives may be able to hope for is that if the legislation is blocked in the Senate it will add to the pile of bills -- which will likely include sweeping voting rights and climate change legislation -- that convinces even skeptics like Biden that his presidential legacy demands removing the filibuster.
But Manchin might also stand in the way again, since he opposes such a fundamental change to the Senate's way of doing -- or not doing -- business, reflecting the power of a single senator in a 50-50 chamber.
How reality dampens demands for action in Washington
The doubtful prospects for gun control legislation don't just show the harsh relative political choices that presidents must make every day, they also underscore the complicated equation set up by the voters of a divided nation in the last election.
Democrats control the presidency as well as both the House and the Senate, by virtue of Vice President Kamala Harris being able to cast the tie-breaking vote on legislation that doesn't have a bipartisan majority. But the characteristics of the US political system and the reality of the filibuster -- which was often used by White conservatives in the past to stall civil rights bills -- mean a party with a thin majority can find it difficult to enact major changes. And the relative power of the minority, especially in a 50-50 Senate, is far greater than that of the political opposition in most parliamentary systems.
Biden would be far from the first modern president to seek gun control and fall short. Former President Barack Obama, who was traumatized by the Sandy Hook massacre, attracted criticism for not dedicating his entire White House to passing gun control in early 2013. And even former President Donald Trump, who was strongly backed by the National Rifle Association, called for change after mass killings in Texas, Ohio and Florida -- though he never made much effort to follow through.
The idea that Republicans will join in any bipartisan effort now to address the root causes of gun violence that would be acceptable to Democrats -- for instance, by slowing gun purchases or limiting access to the deadliest weapons -- did not last even a day after the Colorado killings.
""Every time there's a shooting, we play this ridiculous theater,"" Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing scheduled to discuss gun violence, which was lent more poignant relevance by the latest tragedy.
Cruz was half right -- though he proved Tuesday to be one of the worst offenders in gun politics grandstanding -- arguing that it was Democrats, not Republicans, who blocked serious revisions after the Sandy Hook massacre. Cruz did push a bill that he wrote with Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, that would boost reporting from agencies and law enforcement institutions to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
Critics of the Texas senator dispute his claims that it could have stopped several of the mass killings of recent years and see it as a smokescreen to give Republicans cover in order to avoid voting for legislation that would have a greater effect.
Another Republican, Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, produced the most eye-popping argument of the day, drawing an analogy between mass killers and those who drive under the influence.
""I think what many folks on my side of the aisle are saying is that the answer is not to get rid of all sober drivers,"" said Kennedy, who in 2018 told CNN after the Parkland, Florida, high school rampage that ""idiot control"" -- not gun control -- was needed.
His comments served to underscore the gulf in ambition between Democrats who are pushing for laws that make horrific events like the one in Colorado less likely to happen and Republicans who believe wider ownership of guns, not more restrictions, would make Americans safer.
","Joe Biden's call for an assault weapons ban and a wave of other gun control measures adds a daunting new policy challenge to a progressive agenda that is already shaping up as the most ambitious by a Democratic president for decades.

China may just have doomed its trade deal with Europe,24/3/2021,"The European Union joined the United States and United Kingdom this week in punishing Chinese officials with sanctions over alleged human rights abuses in the country's Xinjiang region. Beijing fired back with sanctions of its own on 10 EU politicians, including members of parliament and four entities, for ""maliciously spreading lies."" 
Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Union trade commissioner, said the fate of the investment agreement, which has not yet been ratified by the European Parliament, is now in doubt.
""China's retaliatory sanctions are regrettable and unacceptable,"" Dombrovskis told the Financial Times in remarks confirmed by his spokesperson. ""The prospects for ... ratification will depend on how the situation evolves."" 
The European Commission, which negotiates trade deals for the 27 EU countries, had already come under fire from members of parliament and activist groups for moving ahead with the investment agreement without securing stronger commitments from China on labor and human rights protections. 
China's dramatic response to sanctions means the investment deal now faces an even tougher path to ratification, underscoring just how difficult it will be for the European Union to balance its economic interests with human rights concerns, especially as the United States wants to work with allies to challenge Beijing.
""The lifting of sanctions against [members of the European parliament] is a pre-condition for us to enter into talks with the Chinese government on the investment deal,"" said Kathleen van Brempt, a member of the European Parliament and spokesperson for the Socialists and Democrats. ""We will not be intimidated, we will not be silenced.""
Guy Verhofstadt, a member of European Parliament and the former prime minister of Belgium, said that China's decision to fire back over sanctions had ""killed"" the deal.
A complicated deal
The investment agreement ！ which aims to promote sustainable development, and improve access for EU investors to China's economy in areas such as health, financial services and electric cars ！ was always going to be tricky to finalize.
Increased tensions between the United States and China are one major reason. Washington is confronting China on a range of economic issues including market access and trade, and it has even accused Beijing of carrying out ""genocide"" against Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang. That's forcing other countries to pick sides.

""The China-EU investment deal has always been a long-shot,"" said Alex Capri, a research fellow at Hinrich Foundation and a visiting senior fellow at National University of Singapore.
Capri said concessions China made to the United States as part of last year's trade truce with the Trump administration had pushed Europe to revive its own agreement. But while Brussels wants to keep up a ""robust"" trading relationship with Beijing, he said, the bloc will ""continue to pivot"" to the United States on many issues, including alignment on artificial intelligence and strategic supply chains. 
""It'll be awkward for the European Parliament to ratify an investment deal with a country that's sanctioned several,"" of its members, said Nick Marro, the lead for global trade at the Economist Intelligence Unit, in a commentary published Tuesday.
Not dead just yet
Marro said that the investment deal isn't ""dead on arrival"" just yet. And several experts have pointed out that it's in Beijing's best interest to bolster economic ties: China is the European Union's second biggest trading partner behind the United States, while the European Union is China's largest trading partner, according to the European Commission.

""The biggest risk to the [investment deal] is not Beijing pulling out, but unleashing an aggressive response that undercuts European support for the pact,"" wrote analysts at Eurasia Group in a research note published late last week.
Some influential voices in China appear to understand that, too. Hu Xijin, the editor of the state-run tabloid the Global Times, played up the ""symbolic"" nature of the sanctions Tuesday on his Weibo account.
""Please note that the mutual sanctions didn't touch trade and the economy, so it's mainly just a verbal fight,"" Hu wrote on the Chinese social media platform. ""The essence of China and the West's relations are business. That's the real interest.""
A 'costly' approach
Brussels and Beijing have huge incentives to preserve their overall economic relationship and prevent further deterioration.
Still, China may have miscalculated its response. Its new sanctions ban several EU politicians from entering mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. And their related companies and institutions will be restricted from doing business with China.
""Chinese diplomacy seems incapable of taking a measured approach when it comes to responding to perceived public affronts,"" said Capri, who added that the reaction ""will prove to be costly.""
Daniel Gros, a distinguished fellow at the Centre for European Policy Studies, said China has ""a bit overreacted."" But he added that ratification of the investment deal is still a long way off, and the spat may not jeopardize it in the long run. 
Even so, geopolitical tensions could increase over the coming year. Gros pointed to Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and China's confrontational diplomacy as potential flash points. 
""If there's more evidence of human rights violations against the Uyghurs, all these things could and would influence the final decision,"" Gros said.

Hong Kong and Macao suspend BioNTech coronavirus vaccine rollout due to packaging defect,24/3/2021,"Both governments said in statements Wednesday they had received a letter from BioNTech and its Chinese partner, Fosun Pharma, indicating an issue with the seal on individual vials in batch number 210102.
According to government figures, as of Tuesday, 150,200 people in Hong Kong had received their first dose of the BioNTech vaccine, which outside of China is partnered with US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer.
Although both Fosun and BioNTech ""have not found any reason to believe that product safety is at risk,"" the Hong Kong government said it was suspending vaccinations involving batch 210102, and halting plans to administer a second batch pending an investigation.
""These are preventive measures to continuously ensure the safety of the vaccination program,"" the statement read.
Prior to halting the BioNTech rollout, Hong Kong offered residents a choice of two vaccines, BioNTech, and Chinese produced Sinovac. Now those who wish to get vaccinated must either wait until the issue with the BioNTech doses is resolved or go with Sinovac.
Hong Kong is expected to receive doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine at a later date. 
Slow rollout linked to vaccine hesitancy
The BioNTech suspension will likely blunt Hong Kong's mass vaccination drive, which is already moving at a slower-than-expected pace. 
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Tuesday that 6% of the population had taken their first shot, which she described as ""not bad,"" though admitted the city could ""do better."" 
""Hong Kong is actually very fortunate, as far as vaccination is concerned,"" said Lam. ""When many places all over the world are scrambling for vaccines, we have a pretty assured supply of vaccines for the people of Hong Kong."" 
The government decided last week to expand the program to include all residents over the age of 30, who account for nearly 80% of the population. The renewed vaccine drive followed an uptick in case numbers that saw hundreds of people sent to quarantine camps across the territory.
Authorities began rolling out the Sinovac vaccine first, on February 18, followed by BioNTech in early March. 
Though an estimated 252,800 people have so far received their first dose of Sinovac, hesitancy has been an issue, with many citing a lack of public data regarding clinical trials. 
In January late-stage trials conducted in Brazil revealed Sinovac to have an efficacy rate of 50.38%, only barely crossing the 50% efficacy threshold as set by the World Health Organization. 
There have been reports of local doctors recommending their patients take the BioNTech vaccine, due to the lack of public data for Sinovac. 
Lam condemned those medical professionals Monday and accused them of trying to ""sabotage"" the government's vaccination program by ""spreading fake news, misinformation and rumors.""
""Especially when these people are health professionals, I am extremely disappointed, because at the end of the day if Hong Kong has a major outbreak again, the people who suffer will be our healthcare professionals, especially those working in the Hospital Authority's facilities,"" she said. 
Reports of a number of deaths among patients over 60 who had recently received the vaccine have also fueled public concern, however, the government said preliminary findings indicated the vaccine was not responsible.
While Hong Kong's vaccine rollout has been not proceeded as quickly as planned, its preventative measures have been among the world's most effective. 
As of Wednesday, just 11,410 people in this city of more than 7 million had contracted the virus. Just 204 have died, fewer than the number of people killed in the SARS epidemic in the early 2000s. And there have been no hard lockdowns.

"5 things to know for March 24: Colorado, Covid-19, White House, Myanmar, North Korea",24/3/2021,"Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 
(You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)
1. Colorado shooting
We now know the identities of the 10 victims of Monday's mass shooting at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado. We also know more about the suspect, 21-year-old Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, who was taken into custody after the shooting and faces 10 counts of murder. What police don't know is any concrete motive. As more information comes out, members of Congress are calling for federal action on gun legislation. Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat, is urging fellow lawmakers to consider what he calls ""common sense"" gun laws, and some options are already on the table. Just two weeks ago, the Democratic-led House passed two bills that would expand background checks on all commercial gun sales. The worry is that, as with past pushes for gun reform, nothing will actually pass. The city of Boulder banned assault weapons in 2018, but a judge recently ruled it can't actually enforce the ban.

2. Coronavirus
At least a dozen states have eased coronavirus restrictions this month, and now Indiana and Virginia are about to join the list with expanded restaurant and venue capacities, among other measures. This is all despite continued warnings from experts that reopenings, combined with unpredictable Covid-19 variants, could spike case numbers again. The UK is taking a decidedly different tack: Under new regulations set to be voted on tomorrow, anyone taking nonessential vacations abroad while regulations are still in place could face a $7,000 fine. Need another reminder that the pandemic definitely isn't over? India just reported its highest single-day death toll this year.

3. White House
The special enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act will be extended to August 15, the Biden administration announced. The change will give Americans more time to take advantage of benefits in the Covid-19 relief law. Meanwhile, more Biden Cabinet nominees are being confirmed: Dr. Vivek Murthy was confirmed as US surgeon general, a role he held in the Obama administration. Shalanda Young was confirmed as the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. Two Asian American senators, Tammy Duckworth and Mazie Hirono, have raised issues about Asian American representation on Biden's team. But they've backed off threats to oppose certain nominees after the White House agreed to add a senior-level Asian American Pacific Islander liaison.

4. Myanmar
Hundreds of Burmese citizens, including police officers, government officials and civilians, are fleeing Myanmar as violence over last month's military coup worsens. Tens of thousands of people continue to protest across the country despite violent suppression by the junta's police and military forces. Reports of a 7-year-old girl killed in her father's arms by police during a raid have further inflamed the rage and pain. Today, protesters are calling for a ""silent strike,"" with businesses and shops set to close and people to stay in their homes with the aim of shutting down entire cities. Overall, at least 275 people? have been killed since the coup, according to a Burmese nonprofit, and up to 2,400 people have been detained, the United Nations says.

5. North Korea
North Korea has conducted its first weapons test since President Biden took office, launching two projectiles last weekend. The test had been widely expected, and officials have downplayed the event as falling ""on the low end of the spectrum"" of provocative actions the regime could carry out. The projectiles were reportedly not ballistic missiles, a designation that the Biden administration says does not qualify as a serious breach. This means the test won't dissuade the US from further pursuing diplomacy with Pyongyang. Biden is still mulling his official policy on the nuclear threat posed by North Korea, and lawmakers and key US allies are eagerly awaiting details, which they expect will be announced publicly in the coming weeks.

Elon Musk is trying to win China back,24/3/2021,"The Tesla CEO lavished praise on China during an interview with state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV), where he pledged that the country would become his electric carmaker's ""biggest market"" in the long run. He also lauded China's economic and climate goals ！ the country is currently the world's top greenhouse emitter, but has promised to drastically reduce the emissions over the next decade or so. 
""I'm very confident about Tesla's future in China,"" Musk told CCTV during the interview, which the broadcaster published online late Tuesday. ""The Chinese economy I think can do extremely well over the next decade and will become the biggest economy in the world. And it's also committed to a sustainable energy future.""
The charm offensive may be pivotal to Tesla's future in China. While the company has enjoyed special treatment from Chinese authorities in the past few years, it has faced an onslaught of criticism in recent weeks.  
Last month, Tesla (TSLA) was summoned by Chinese officials to face questions about the quality of its Shanghai-made cars. And over the weekend, a handful of media outlets reported that military had banned Tesla vehicles from entering its complexes over concerns that cameras equipped onboard could be used for spying. 
Musk addressed those spying concerns on Saturday, saying at a Chinese development conference that his company's cars would never be used for such purposes. 
But his remarks on CCTV went a step further toward lauding Beijing and emphasizing the importance of the market to Tesla. China already accounts for a fifth of Tesla's revenue and is its second largest market after the United States, according to a recent company filing.
In the long term, China ""will be our biggest market, both where we make the most number of vehicles and where we have the most number of customers,"" Musk told CCTV.
Musk even singled out Beijing's ambitious blueprint for economic dominance over the next five years, and said he was impressed with the country's climate goals. Chinese President Xi Jinping said last September that the country would be carbon neutral by 2060, and the government has detailed some ways it intends to achieve that target, including building more nuclear power stations and clean energy facilities.
""These are very aggressive goals. And I think they are great goals. And I wish more countries actually had these goals,"" Musk said. ""I'm very confident that future of China is gonna be great.""
Even though he does not speak Chinese, Musk is one of the most popular American business leaders in China. A video of him dancing on stage during the debut of the Shanghai-made Model 3 early last year went viral on Weibo. And Premier Li Keqiang once even said he would be happy to give Musk a ""China green card"" after the American entrepreneur said he ""loves China very much.""
Musk also has some 1.7 million followers on Weibo, a prominent Chinese social media platform ！ more than Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook. He still trails Microsoft (MSFT) founder Bill Gates, who has 4.1 million followers. By Wednesday afternoon, the hashtag about Musk's CCTV interview had already generated more than three million views.

10 killed in Colorado grocery store shooting,24/3/2021,,"Kroger said three employees were among those killed in the shooting at King Soopers in Boulder, Colorado.? They were Denny Stong, Rikki Olds, and Teri Leiker, the company said in a statement. ""In the hours since the shooting, we¨re learning of truly heroic acts that included associates, customers, and first responders selflessly acting to protect and save others. We will remain forever grateful to the first responders who so bravely to protect our associates and customers,"" Kroger said, adding that the company was ""horrified and heartbroken over the senseless violence."" ""The entire Kroger family offers our thoughts, prayers and support to those impacted by this tragedy, including our associates, customers and first responders, and their families."" ##Victims## First lady Jill Biden called for action Tuesday following a mass shooting that left 10 dead at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado. ＾Ten more lives have been stolen by gun violence. The grief we feel is heartbreakingly familiar, but we cannot become numb to it.?We must act now,"" she tweeted. Monday's shooting comes just days after eight were killed in a series of shootings in the Atlanta area. President Biden is facing growing pressure to act on guns in the wake of these latest mass shootings. The suspect in the Boulder, Colorado, shooting pleaded guilty to third-degree assault?approximately three years ago after?attacking a high school classmate, according to court documents and a police report. In February 2018, Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa was charged with assault after allegedly attacking a classmate at Arvada West High School in the Denver suburb of Arvada. The case stemmed from a November 2017 incident in which Alissa, then-18, ＾got up in [a] classroom, walked over?to [the] victim & ｀cold-cocked¨ him in the head,￣ according to a report from a police officer included in the case file. Alissa ＾got on top of [the victim] & punched him in [the] head?several more times,￣ the report says, adding that the victim ＾had bruising, swelling & cuts to [the] head, as well as pain.￣ The officer wrote, ＾No witnesses could see or hear any reason￣ for the attack,?and that Alissa said that the victim ＾had made fun of him & called him racial names weeks earlier.￣ Alissa, who is now 21, pleaded guilty in March 2018 and was sentenced to one year probation, 48 hours of community service, and ＾treatment to address response to anger,￣ according to the court documents. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis told CNN that his state is still stunned in the wake of yesterday¨s shooting at King Soopers supermarket in Boulder. ＾This is just where everybody goes to pick up groceries, right? We have a few big grocery stores in town, like in most towns across the country, people go buy groceries,￣ Polis told CNN's Pamela Brown on the ""The Situation Room"" Tuesday. ＾Never ever does it cross your mind that that trip to the grocery store could be your last moments on earth. I think all of us are going to have those little flutters in our hearts as we go shopping next time, just recognizing what happened here in Boulder.￣ The governor said he ordered flags throughout the state to be flown at half-staff for 10 days to honor the 10 victims in Monday¨s shooting. He said he will speak with the families of the victims ＾when they¨re ready to take the call.￣ Polis also said he spoke with President Biden today after the President called for a ban on assault weapons and for Congress to pass two-gun control measures. ＾We had a good conversation,￣ the governor said. ＾He expressed his condolences, He's seen a lot of loss in his life, including, of course, his son and his wife, and so many others. He's no stranger to loss.￣ ＾He gave some comforting words to Colorado. To me, I think there will be a broad discussion about the policy side,￣ Polis continued. ＾We have, for instance, universal background checks in Colorado, but some of our neighboring states don't. I know Congress is looking at closing that loophole.￣ ＾For now, we're really trying to do our best to comfort the families, the friends of the 10 people who are no longer with us,￣ he added. ? A memorial is forming outside the King Soopers supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, Tuesday afternoon, near where 10 people were shot and killed a day before. People gathered near the store to leave flowers, notes and crosses in tribute to the victims. Mike Malone, head coach of the NBA¨s Denver Nuggets, opened his Tuesday pregame media session by naming the victims of the Boulder shooting, breaking down into tears after doing so. ＾I think we¨re all tired of it. I think that¨s an understatement,￣ a visibly distraught Malone said. He went on to continue and once again was driven to tears, pausing intermittently, saying, ＾We get judged on wins and losses. I apologize. We get judged on wins and losses, but if you take a step back and you put yourself in one of those families, what do you feel?￣ Malone fought through his emotions and spoke further about Eric Talley, the Boulder police officer who was killed in the shooting. ＾I think about Eric Talley and his seven kids,￣ Malone said. ＾That¨s what I think about. I¨m just heartbroken for them and everybody else. Hopefully we as a country, we as a state can find a way to be better.￣ The Nuggets are in Orlando and will play the Orlando Magic at 7 p.m. ET. Boulder Mayor Sam Weaver said that gun reform measures should be strengthened at the state and federal level after a mass shooting left 10 dead at a supermarket in his Colorado city.? ＾The real message is cities?can't handle this problem.?The rules need to come from the?state and the federal level, so?what I'll be sharing with the?President ！ if I speak to him ！ is?that we would really appreciate?his support. And the interview he?gave today indicates that he's?with us and we really need?everyone to make their?voices heard at this time,￣ he told CNN¨s Jake Tapper. Earlier, President Biden called on Congress to pass an assault weapons ban and tighten background checks.  The mayor said an assault weapons ban was passed in the city in 2018, but earlier this month, a Colorado district court judge blocked the city from enforcing its ban. Weaver added, ＾I'm not certain that if the ban?had not been overturned that?this killer would have made any?different choices.￣? While there are background checks and other measures in place in the state, ＾the results of yesterday's?shooting show us that they are?not strong enough,￣ Weaver said. ? ＾I don't think they are?sufficient, and they certainly?weren't sufficient to prevent?yesterday's tragedy,￣ Weaver said.? ＾The only positive thing to come?out of this will be that our?community will bond together and?work through our pain, and then?we'll look to the future and see?if there are ways to prevent?this from ever happening to?another community,￣ he added. Watch:  ##Gun Policy## Two of the victims in Monday¨s mass shooting at King Soopers supermarket were recent graduates of area high schools, according to a statement from Boulder Valley School District Superintendent Rob Anderson. Denny Stong was a 2019 graduate of Fairview High School and Rikki Olds was a 2013 graduate of Centaurus High School, Anderson said in a statement Tuesday. ＾Several of the other victims were parents of our graduates and given the fact that this is a close-knit community, there will likely be many other connections to BVSD schools both amongst those who were killed and other victims,￣ Anderson said. ＾While we cannot fathom what would cause such an evil, we know that many in our community acted bravely when faced with unspeakable violence.￣ ##Victims## A now-removed?Facebook profile is shedding more light on the Colorado shooting suspect,?21-year-old Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa.? A high school classmate,?and Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa's brother Ali Aliwi Alissa, confirmed to CNN the Facebook page¨s?authenticity.?A Facebook spokesperson confirmed to CNN the company had removed Facebook and Instagram accounts belonging to the suspect. In a number of Facebook posts, the shooting suspect made homophobic remarks and in two posts, even used?anti-gay slurs.?? He also claimed?to believe?that his former high school had been hacking into his phone.? ""Just curious what are the laws about phone privacy because I believe my old school (a west) was hacking my phone,"" the suspect wrote in a March 18, 2019 Facebook post.?? He made a second post on July 5, 2019, also claiming that ""racist islamophobic people"" were hacking his phone, saying, ""let me have a normal life I probably could.""??? When questioned about it by his Facebook friends about?how?he believed that the school was hacking his phone, Alissa responded, ""I believe part racism for sure. But I also believe someone spread rumors about me which are false and maybe that set it off.""?? The profile claims that Alissa attended Arvada West High School; Jefferson County Public Schools spokesperson Cameron Bell confirms he was a student there from March 2015 until he graduated in May 2018.?? Bell did not immediately respond with a comment on Alissa's Facebook post. That post comes in light of what his brother also told CNN, namely that?he believes?the suspect?may have?suffered from mental illness and that around 2014, Alissa felt he was being followed and chased and became increasingly ＾paranoid.""?? At one point, his brother remembers Alissa even placed duct-tape over the camera on his computer to block anyone he believed to be following him, he said. ＾He always suspected someone was behind him, someone was chasing him,￣ Ali Alissa said. ＾We kept a close eye on him when he was in high school. He would say, ｀someone is chasing me, someone is investigating me,¨ and we¨re like, ｀come on man, there¨s nothing.¨ ´ He was just closing into himself.￣? Alissa also posted videos of him purportedly wrestling in high school.?He occasionally made posts about his Muslim faith. ""Born in Syria 1999 came to the USA in 2002,"" Alissa wrote in his profile description.?""I like wrestling and informational documentaries.""?? In 2015, like many Facebook users, he changed his profile picture to the French flag in the wake of the terrorist attacks at a musical venue in Paris.?He also shared a post from another Facebook user about Islamophobia in the aftermath of the April 2019 Christchurch, New Zealand mosque shootings. ""The Muslims at the #christchurch mosque were not the victims of a single shooter,"" the shared post read.?""They were the victims of the entire Islamophobia industry that villified [sic] them."" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer declined to comment on Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin¨s opposition to the House-passed gun background check bills, when asked by CNN¨s Jessica Dean.  Schumer said he¨s going to meet with Sen. Chris Murphy, who is sponsoring the Background Check Expansion Act, and other Democrats and they¨ll figure out ＾the best way to move forward￣ on gun reform legislation. Biden pressed the Senate earlier today?to take up the gun legislation that the House has passed in the wake of a mass shooting in Boulder, Colorado, that killed 10 people at a grocery store.? The New York Democrat also sidestepped CNN¨s question on whether Democrats would consider a narrower piece of legislation on background checks, like Manchin-Toomey, at his weekly policy presser on Tuesday. Schumer noted that he will bring both the House-passed background check bills to the floor for a vote. He would not, however, nail down a timeline for when he¨d bring them to the Senate floor, pointing to how ＾there¨s a whole lot of things that we want to do￣ like confirming nominees, confirming judges, a China bill, among many others. Schumer also said that flags at the US Capitol are being lowered to half-staff today to honor the victims of the horrific shooting in Colorado. ##Gun Policy## Authorities have released the arrest warrant for Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 21, who is the suspect in yesterday's mass shooting at a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado.  The document, released by Boulder County officials,?provides new details about the shooting that left 10 dead. The document describes Alissa as being armed with either an assault rifle or ""black AR-15"" and wearing a ""tactical"" or ""armored"" vest. The 10 victims were ""were located in the store and in the parking lot of the business, including a deceased party in a vehicle in the parking lot.""?? The ""deceased party"" was?in a vehicle?parked next to a car that officers believe belongs to Alissa's brother. ""A green rifle case was observed in the front passenger compartment,"" the affidavit added. The document described how ""employees observed the suspect shoot an elderly man in the parking lot."" ""The suspect then walked up to the elderly man, stood over him and shot him multiple additional times,"" it added. Although the full chronology of the shooting is still unclear, the document describes SWAT officers making entry into the supermarket and responding to a downed officer,?Eric?Talley. ""Officer Talley was obviously deceased from a bullet wound to the head,"" the affidavit says.? Shortly after that, the affidavit says an officer ""heard SWAT Operators in voice contact with someone."" That person turned out to be Alissa ""walking backward to the SWAT Team to be taken into custody."" ""Alissa had removed all of his clothing and was dressed only in shorts,"" the affidavit adds.? After Alissa was walked out of the store, he wouldn't tell officers if there were other suspects. ""The suspect did not answer questions, though he asked to speak to his mother,"" the document says. The affidavit says that Alissa's items that he ""removed on scene included a green tactical vest, a rifle (possible AR-15), a semiautomatic handgun, a pair of jeans and a dark colored long-sleeved shirt."" The affidavit says that ""using law enforcement databases, investigators determined that Alissa had purchased a Ruger AR556 pistol on March 16, 2021."" Alissa faces 10 charges of murder in the first degree and one charge of attempted murder, according to the warrant.? White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday the White House is considering taking executive actions on gun safety measures and to address violence in communities.? ＾We are certainly considering a range of levers, including working through legislation, including executive actions to address, obviously, you know, not just gun safety measures but violence in communities, so that has been under discussion and will continue to be under discussion,￣ Psaki told reporters aboard Air Force One.? Some more context: Earlier on Tuesday,?Biden pressed the Senate?to take up gun legislation that the House has passed in the wake of a mass shooting in Boulder, Colorado, that killed 10 people at a grocery store.? ##Gun Policy## Facebook has shut down Facebook and Instagram accounts belonging to the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado, mass shooting, a company spokesperson told CNN Tuesday.? The Facebook spokesperson said the company is in contact with law enforcement and that it will remove any content that praises the shooting or the suspect.? Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin said the government can combat gun violence the same way they tackled the opioid crisis.? ""We can do this,"" Durbin said during his opening remarks during a hearing on gun violence Tuesday. ""The fact that guns are lawful products with legitimate uses, must not stop us from taking action to reduce gun deaths. Look at opioids. They have a lawful legitimate use, but Congress recognizes the public health catastrophe that resulted from the misuse of opioids, and we did something."" Durbin said when they announced holding this hearing?on ""Constitutional and Common Sense Steps to Reduce Gun Violence""?last week Tuesday it was prior to the mass shooting in Georgia and as he was preparing his remarks on Monday, 10 people were killed in Boulder, Colorado. ""We?can't keep up with it. I can't change them in my opening statement, to keep up with it.?It just keeps coming at us,"" Durbin said.  ""We're numb to the numbers, unless we are personally touched. It's just another statistic. That has got to stop. This committee, this hearing, I hope will open a conversation about constitutional common sense ways to reduce gun violence in America.""? ""We are Senate leaders, what are we doing other than reflecting and praying?"" Durbin said.? Before showing a brief video of a montage of gun violence coverage on the news, Durbin said that an average 109 Americans lives are lost to gun violence C suicides, murders, accidental shootings, homicides C ""the numbers are sobering ...?We've seen too many desperate trips to the emergency room too many funerals too many families and communities have been scarred forever by gun violence. We've come to accept it as part of American life.""? Durbin said that while gun violence disproportionately affects people of color ""nobody is immune.""? ##Gun Policy## As the?hearing?on?gun reform measures opened this morning in the?Senate?Judiciary Committee, the political red lines that have been a hallmark of the issue for decades reemerge. In opening statements, Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut accused Republicans of having no solutions?on?guns. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, pushed back, citing efforts he and Sen. Chuck Grassley have undertaken that are more incremental and blasted Democrats for pushing gun reform every time there is a shooting. ＾We have had far too many tragedies in our country,￣ Cruz said.?＾I¨ve been to too damn many of these. Every time there is a shooting, we play this ridiculous theater´￣ ＾Democrats propose taking away?guns?from law abiding citizens,￣ Cruz said. ＾When you disarm law abiding citizens, you make them more likely to be victims. If you want to stop these murders go after the murders.￣ Grassley, the top Republican?on?Judiciary, argued part of the problem is that the police are not funded well enough. ＾We cannot reduce violence in our communities without a professional, well-trained and fully-funded police force,￣ Grassley said. Today's hearing comes as President Biden faces growing pressure to act on gun reform after the latest mass shootings in Boulder, Colorado, and in the Atlanta area.? In remarks this afternoon, President Biden urged the Senate to pass a pair of House-passed gun reforms, including a universal background checks measure and an assault weapons ban. ##Gun Policy## Ali Aliwi Alissa confirmed to CNN that?the footage of a handcuffed man bleeding from his leg and?being led away from the scene of the shooting in Boulder, Colorado, is his?brother and shooting suspect, 21-year-old Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa.?? There are two videos that show Alissa: one taken by a live streamer on the ground and another from CNN affiliate KMGH¨s helicopter.? In the videos, the man now identified as Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa is seen with his right leg covered in blood and is being led away from the scene in handcuffs, by two first responders.?? In a news conference on Tuesday morning, authorities said they believe he is the only person involved in the shooting and that there?is?no additional threat to the community.?They would not confirm that the man seen being led out in handcuffs was the suspect, but?Boulder Police Chief Maris Herold confirmed?the suspect was wounded in the leg during ＾an exchange of gunfire.￣ Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said Alissa is a resident of the Denver suburb of Arvada, Colorado, who has ＾lived most of his life in the United States.￣ President Biden said he would do everything in his power to keep Americans safe following the latest mass shooting in Colorado and pushed the Senate to immediately pass two House-passed gun reforms, including a universal background checks measure and an assault weapons ban. ""I don't need to wait another minute, let alone an hour, to take common sense steps that will save lives in the future,"" he said in remarks from the White House. He listed a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as strengthening the background check system by closing loopholes, as areas he would like to see Congress act on.  ""The Senate should immediately?pass, let me say it again, the United States Senate, I hope?some are listening, should?immediately pass the two House-passed bills that close?loopholes in the background?check system.?These are bills that received?votes with both Republicans and?Democrats in the House.?This is not and should not be a?partisan issue.?This is an American issue.?It will save lives.?American lives.?We have to act,"" he added. Watch: ##Gun Policy## President Biden offered his condolences to the families of the victims of the Boulder shooting and vowed to use all the?resources at his disposal ""to keep?the American people safe."" ""Ten lives have been lost,?and more families have been?shattered by gun violence in the?state of Colorado.?And Jill and I are devastated,"" Biden said in remarks from the White House.  Biden praised the heroism of slain Boulder Police Officer Eric Talley, one of 10 people killed in yesterday's shooting.  ""I?commend the exceptional bravery?of Officer Eric Talley.?I send my deepest condolence to?his family.?His close, close family of seven?children.?You know, when he pinned on that?badge yesterday morning he?didn't know what the day would?bring.?I want everybody to think about?this,"" Biden said. ""But when the moment to act came?Officer Talley did not hesitate?in his duty making the ultimate?sacrifice in his effort to save?lives.?That's the definition of an?American hero."" The President said he's been briefed by the FBI and the attorney general on the shooting, and that the White House is working closely with local and state law enforcement officials on the investigation. Biden noted that at this moment, ""a great deal remains unknown"" about the shooting. Biden ＾directed that all flags at the White House be flown at half staff￣ to honor the victims, according to a White House statement.? Yesterday's shooting comes just days after eight were killed in a series of shootings in the Atlanta area.?The President is facing growing pressure to act on guns in the wake of these latest mass shootings. Watch the moment: Ten people, including a police officer, were killed Monday after a gunman opened fire in a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado.  CNN correspondent Dan Simon was live on the scene and answered viewers' questions about the investigation. Watch:  The suspect in Monday's grocery store shooting in Colorado, Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 21, has been booked into Boulder County Jail, according to the jail's records. Alissa was booked today at?12:49 p.m. local time, according to the county site. Officials previously said he was receiving treatment at a hospital for a gunshot wound to the leg. President Biden has issued a proclamation for flags to be flown at half-staff to honor the victims of the Boulder shooting. A statement just released by the White House says: ""As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts?of violence perpetrated on March 22, 2021, in?Boulder, Colorado, by the authority vested in me as President of?the United States by the?Constitution and the laws of the United?States of America, I?hereby order that the flag of?the United?States shall be flown at half-staff at the White?House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United?States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, March 27, 2021."" Biden also directed flags to be flown at?half-staff for all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and?stations. Just last week, the President ordered the American flags at the White House and on other federal ground to be flown at half-staff as ""a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence"" in Atlanta. Grocery workers ！ who already showed heroism throughout the Covid-19 pandemic ！ were heroes during the Colorado mass shooting, said Kim Cordova, president of UFCW Local 7. The union represents grocery store employees, including those in the King Soopers supermarket in Boulder, where 10 people died on Monday.? ＾These?grocery workers have been?through so much over this last?year dealing with Covid.?You know, customers, the mask?issue ！ it's been really rough?for these employees.?´ They were heroes throughout this?whole pandemic and they were?heroes during this incident,￣ Cordova told CNN¨s Kate Bolduan. ＾Everybody's?really traumatized. There is a lot of shock,￣ she added.? Rikki Olds, 25, has been identified as one of the victims killed in Monday¨s shooting at the supermarket. She was a front-end manager at King Soopers, according to her uncle. Olds was a member of the union in another store but transferred over to the nonunion side of the Boulder store, according to Cordova.? Olds was ＾very nice, very friendly, very?caring,￣ Cordova said.?＾She was always happy, just a really great person.￣? Cordova said she believes there are several other employees who died during the shooting, but did not comment further as the investigation is ongoing. Watch:  Former President Barack Obama put out a statement calling for those in power to address gun violence in the wake of the deadly shooting in Boulder, Colorado.  His statement comes moments ahead of President Biden¨s expected remarks on the matter from the White House. In the statement Obama says: ＾It is long past time for those with the power to fight this epidemic of gun violence to do so. It will take time to root out the disaffection, racism and misogyny that fuels so many of these senseless acts of violence. But we can make it harder for those with hate in their hearts to buy weapons of war. We can overcome opposition by cowardly politicians and the pressure of a gun lobby that opposes any limit on the ability of anyone to assemble an arsenal. We can, and we must.￣ A search of Boulder shooting suspect Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa¨s home turned up other weapons, a senior law enforcement source tells CNN.? The official also updated the description previously given of the weapon used in the killings. The source describes the weapon as an AR-15-style pistol that had been modified with an arm brace. Mason Alexander was working at a tattoo parlor near the King Soopers supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, when the shooting occurred yesterday, leaving 10 dead.? Alexander and his coworkers locked themselves and their customers inside. He said he is still shaken up from it.? ?＾We have become a bit?desensitized to the shootings in America.?But for it to happen right?outside of your front door, you?know, 500 feet from where you?perform your everyday?activities ´ it is shocking.?It is scary.?It is something I wouldn't wish?anybody to have to go through.?´ I¨m lost for words,￣ he told CNN¨s Poppy Harlow.?

To ＾have fellow community?members have their lives taken?from them, it's?indescribable,￣ he added.? Watch:  Police, lawmakers and other officials this morning held a news conference following yesterday's deadly shooting at King Soopers supermarket in Boulder, Colorado.

During Cruz's opening remarks on Tuesday for the?""Constitutional and Common Sense Steps to Reduce Gun Violence"" hearing, he said he has been trying to pass legislation since 2013 that would target ""violent criminals,"" felons, fugitives and ""those with serious mental disease?to stop them from getting firearms to put them in prison, when they try to illegally buy guns.""? ?Cruz said the bill did not pass before because of a ""shameful filibuster"" that was led by Democrats. He said that?combatting gun violence should not take guns away from law abiding citizens.? ""I would ask Senate Democrats, including some of our newer colleagues who just got here, not to participate again in the shameful filibuster, that this body engaged in in 2013, let's target the bad guys the felons the fugitives those with mental disease. Let's put them in jail, let's stop them from getting guns, let's not scapegoat innocent law-abiding citizens and let's not target their constitutional rights,"" Cruz said. ""Every year firearms are used in a defensive capacity to defend women, children, families, roughly a million times a year in the United States.

'Be relentless': What it will take to free two Canadians detained in China,23/3/2021,"Nadjibulla's husband, Michael Kovrig, has been detained in China for more than two years, on espionage charges the Chinese government refuses to explain and Canada's Prime Minister says are ""trumped up"" and politically motivated. 
Kovrig's detention -- along with that of fellow Canadian Micheal Spavor -- followed the arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, a top executive with Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, who is currently fighting extradition to the United States, where she is wanted on charges of breaching sanctions with Iran. 
On Monday, Kovrig's trial finally began in Beijing, but behind closed doors, with journalists and diplomats from more than two-dozen countries refused entry by the Chinese authorities, who said this was because the case involved ""state secrets."" 
Over the years, Canada has tried patience, pleas, and more recently concerted pressure, to no avail. Kovrig remains in a Chinese prison, where Nadjibulla said he has showed remarkable resilience and resolve. 
""He inspires us to stay strong and to be relentless in our efforts to get him freed,"" she told CNN in an interview this week. ""That is the word that he has used for us: 'Stay relentless,' and that is what we must do."" 
Though the two separated prior to Kovrig's arrest, Nadjibulla is still married to Kovrig, and has been a forceful advocate for his release. 
Political detention
Beijing claims that Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat who works for the International Crisis Group, was ""stealing sensitive information and intelligence through contacts in China since 2017,"" while Spavor, a businessman with a focus on North Korea, is accused of providing intelligence to Kovrig. 
But most outside observers see the case as politically motivated, and even China has linked the fate of the ""two Michaels"" -- as they are known in Canada -- to that of Meng, the Huawei executive, who has enjoyed a far more comfortable detention, allowed to live in her Vancouver mansion and travel within the city of Vancouver with security and a tracking device on her ankle.
Ottawa and Washington have denounced the use of the two men as ""bargaining chips."" What becomes of them may well foreshadow what China's reflex will be in the years to come when confronted with Western rules and laws it will not abide by.
After months of attempting to reach a solution via diplomatic channels, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has become increasingly blunt, accusing China of engaging in ""coercive diplomacy."" But while he has come under criticism from some Canadians for not doing more, his options for forcing a release may be limited, with the solution China clearly desires -- releasing Meng -- more dependent on Washington than Ottawa. 
""We've known since day one that ... Michael's fate and that of Michael Spavor are linked to a bigger geopolitical dispute and we must find a solution for that and that is the only way to bring Michael home,"" Nadjibulla said.
She remains cautious about every word she utters on the case, not wanting in any way to compromise Kovrig's quest for freedom. For months following the two men's detention, their families were silent, believing that diplomatic negotiations would be successful in arranging their release.  
But as their cases have dragged on, with the two men held under difficult and worsening conditions in Chinese prisons, this strategy has proven unsuccessful. As well as being denied access to both men's trials this month, Canadian officials were denied access to their citizens for 10 months last year, after China introduced new limits on prison visits due to the coronavirus pandemic.
In contrast, Meng has had dozens of hearings open to the public, the media and Chinese consular officials, as prescribed by Canadian law. She also has a battery of lawyers working on her case in both the US and Canada, while both Canadians have a lawyer provided by the Chinese government, and have not been able to confer with legal advisers of their choice.
And while the ""two Michaels"" have been largely cut off from the outside world, Meng has, by her own admission, continued to live a relatively normal life in her multimillion dollar Vancouver home. Canada also recently confirmed that it had granted her family visas to visit her there, even allowing special exemptions from pandemic restrictions. 
Nadjibulla said she last heard from her husband in a letter in January. He is afforded few privileges, even things that are taken for granted in Canadian prisons, like exercise and fresh air.  
""Michael describes the conditions as difficult, they're almost monastic,"" she said. ""He gets to read books, which has been his solace, that is something we advocated quite hard for, for him to be able to get access to books and reading books is what's keeping him going.""
Despite not being allowed outside, Nadjibulla added that Kovrig has been committed to walking 7,000-steps per day around his cell. 
Digging in
Canada's ambassador to China returned to Ottawa in recent days to further consult with government ministers on China policy as Beijing was hit with a new round of international sanctions -- including by Canada -- over its crackdown in Xinjiang.
Those sanctions were announced in coordination with Washington, which has stepped up its advocacy for the ""two Michaels,"" who many Canadians see as being detained as a result of US actions. 
Canadian officials said US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken raised the issue during a meeting with Chinese diplomats in Alaska last week, adding that the US has agreed to ""treat these two individuals as if they were American citizens.""
Speaking earlier this month, Trudeau said ""China needs to understand that it is not just about two Canadians, it is the respect for the rule of law and relationships with a broad range of Western countries that is at play with the arbitrary detention and the coercive diplomacy they have engaged in.""
China does not appear shaken, however, and if anything is digging in. The country's embassy in Ottawa has recently criticized the Canadian government for the arrest of Meng, and steadfastly insisted that the ""two Michaels"" were arrested for undermining national security. 
""On the one hand, the Canadian side claims that it upholds the rule of law, but on the other hand, it makes irresponsible remarks with regards to China's handling relevant cases in accordance with law,"" the embassy said in a statement. 
""How hypocritical and arrogant! When it comes to arbitrary detention, Ms. Meng Wanzhou has been arbitrarily detained for over two years despite the fact that she hasn't violated any Canadian law. This is arbitrary detention in every sense of the term.""

Such rhetoric has raised the stakes for the men's families. What could have been a tricky bilateral dispute resolved within months has escalated into a major confrontation that could play a role in reshaping China's relations with the West for years to come.
Nadjibulla believes the support of the Biden administration could give efforts to free the two Canadians new momentum. But she is also realistic about the Chinese position, and what it will take to reach a compromise that will satisfy both parties, particularly with Beijing tying the case explicitly to that of Meng. 
""There are people who I know are working on this and my sincere hope is that they see this moment and this development [of a trial] as a stark reminder that real lives are on the line and we must do everything we can to bring them home,"" she said. 
And as relentless as the past two years have been for her, Nadjibulla said she is always mindful that Kovrig is completely alone.
""It has been difficult for all of us here but nothing in comparison to what Michael has endured and he has done so with so much dignity and strength of character, his courage, his resilience, his ability to remain positive is what inspires me,"" she said. ""He is in a fight for his life, for his freedom and it is my honor to be in his corner and to continue that fight until the day he's freed.""
","From her home in Toronto, Vina Nadjibulla fields hundreds of emails, texts, and phone calls, all about the only person she really wants to hear from.  Nadjibulla's husband, Michael Kovrig, has been detained in China for more than two years, on espionage charges the Chinese government refuses to explain and Canada's Prime Minister says are ""trumped up"" and politically motivated.

Nadjibulla said she last heard from her husband in a letter in January. He is afforded few privileges, even things that are taken for granted in Canadian prisons, like exercise and fresh air.   ""Michael describes the conditions as difficult, they're almost monastic,"" she said. ""He gets to read books, which has been his solace, that is something we advocated quite hard for, for him to be able to get access to books and reading books is what's keeping him going."" Despite not being allowed outside, Nadjibulla added that Kovrig has been committed to walking 7,000-steps per day around his cell.  Digging in Canada's ambassador to China returned to Ottawa in recent days to further consult with government ministers on China policy as Beijing was hit with a new round of international sanctions -- including by Canada -- over its crackdown in Xinjiang. Those sanctions were announced in coordination with Washington, which has stepped up its advocacy for the ""two Michaels,"" who many Canadians see as being detained as a result of US actions.  Canadian officials said US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken raised the issue during a meeting with Chinese diplomats in Alaska last week, adding that the US has agreed to ""treat these two individuals as if they were American citizens."" Speaking earlier this month, Trudeau said ""China needs to understand that it is not just about two Canadians, it is the respect for the rule of law and relationships with a broad range of Western countries that is at play with the arbitrary detention and the coercive diplomacy they have engaged in."" China does not appear shaken, however, and if anything is digging in. The country's embassy in Ottawa has recently criticized the Canadian government for the arrest of Meng, and steadfastly insisted that the ""two Michaels"" were arrested for undermining national security.  ""On the one hand, the Canadian side claims that it upholds the rule of law, but on the other hand, it makes irresponsible remarks with regards to China's handling relevant cases in accordance with law,"" the embassy said in a statement.  ""How hypocritical and arrogant! When it comes to arbitrary detention, Ms. Meng Wanzhou has been arbitrarily detained for over two years despite the fact that she hasn't violated any Canadian law. This is arbitrary detention in every sense of the term."" Such rhetoric has raised the stakes for the men's families. What could have been a tricky bilateral dispute resolved within months has escalated into a major confrontation that could play a role in reshaping China's relations with the West for years to come. Nadjibulla believes the support of the Biden administration could give efforts to free the two Canadians new momentum. But she is also realistic about the Chinese position, and what it will take to reach a compromise that will satisfy both parties, particularly with Beijing tying the case explicitly to that of Meng.  ""There are people who I know are working on this and my sincere hope is that they see this moment and this development [of a trial] as a stark reminder that real lives are on the line and we must do everything we can to bring them home,"" she said.  And as relentless as the past two years have been for her, Nadjibulla said she is always mindful that Kovrig is completely alone. ""It has been difficult for all of us here but nothing in comparison to what Michael has endured and he has done so with so much dignity and strength of character, his courage, his resilience, his ability to remain positive is what inspires me,"" she said. ""He is in a fight for his life, for his freedom and it is my honor to be in his corner and to continue that fight until the day he's freed.""",asia,WORLD
Joe Biden's legislative priorities: Gun control and five other issues fight to move forward in Congress,23/3/2021,"The understanding was that every other priority: guns, immigration, infrastructure, climate and voting rights could wait on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers were fully on-board, redirecting plans so that nothing would distract from a unified message.
But, the quiet part of that equation was that passing anything other than the Covid relief bill was always going to be a major slog. Now, more than halfway through Biden's first 100 days, interests are competing in what should come next, what is possible and where the party goes from here. Members are beginning to roll out their long-awaited plans and the legislative agenda suddenly feels like it could go in several direction.
But the reality is that the party is still extremely limited by both the rules of the Senate and the members there in what it can do. The focus right now is on infrastructure and what to do about China on the hill. While Democrats have been waiting for four years for this moment, while they've been promising communities across the country the kind of change that comes along once in a generation on immigration, on guns and on voting rights, Congress is not equipped right now to support the kind of Democratic shift that perhaps progressives and voters thought they could get when Democrats won control of the House, Senate and White House.  
The following is a breakdown of where some key items stand:
What's next
The next legislative agenda item that the White House has bought into is passing a bipartisan bill to rein in China's influence and impact on the US economy. That effort certainly isn't on Democratic voters' list of desires. It probably doesn't crack the top 10, but it does give the administration an opportunity to reset the table with Republicans, build something bipartisan and perhaps create some momentum to begin conversations with Republicans on infrastructure. This bill is about building relationships, and if Republicans can't get there, Democrats are also happy to have it as a legislative legacy item they can use when Republicans accuse them of being soft on China.
Infrastructure
The key thing to keep in mind on infrastructure is that this massive bill is still very much a work in progress. Lawmakers are still in the ideas phase right now. They have priorities they've been working on for years. They have plans they can quickly roll into legislation, but they don't have a process yet. They don't have a decision on if they'll work with Republicans or have to pass the bill through reconciliation. They don't know how much of their climate agenda will fit and how much of the legislation will be paid for or even how you could cover the cost. The White House's trial balloon Monday of spending $3 trillion spread over two components: a workforce modernization piece as well as a bricks and mortar infrastructure piece came after lawmakers have been saying for weeks that they don't want to get ahead of the White House on how this will all be structured.
Key things to watch on infrastructure: Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and the Senate Finance Committee chairman, will spend the next several weeks rolling out a series of plans to potentially pay for infrastructure. Next week, expect to see a plan to retool international taxes to cover pieces of infrastructure. You've also seen ideas floating around of raising the corporate rate. Democrats are very serious about that option because it creates a dial where every point you go up gives you about $100 billion in revenue. The other option is lowering the cost of prescription drugs. There are multiple ideas floating around, but the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that plans that deal with price adjustment can generate $500 billion in revenue. That's why prescription drugs may become part of this discussion.
Guns
The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing Tuesday on the future of gun control in the Senate. The House passed two bills earlier this month that tackled who can buy a gun and how to close loopholes on background checks. We've said it before and will say it again: the votes are not there in the Senate to pass the House bills. The votes are not there to pass an assault weapons ban. The votes are not there to limit the number of magazines. The major difference between what Republicans are willing to do on background checks and what Democrats are willing to do on background checks is that most members agree that if you are going to go and buy a gun from a licensed firearm dealer or at a gun show, you should have a background check. What they don't agree on and have struggled to agree on in the past is whether when you sell a gun to a family member or friend or privately transfer a gun, do you have to run a background check? That's why a failed 2013 bill to expand background checks on gun sales from West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin and Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey was a big deal. It struck a compromise. But, Manchin-Toomey isn't the bill that Democrats are talking about bringing up for a vote.
Right now, Schumer has pledged to bring the House's background check bill to the floor. It required background checks on everything. It was universal. That does not have the votes.
Immigration
As a surge of migrant children continues on the border, Congress has yet to receive any supplemental funding request from the administration to tackle the problem with more money. For now, the focus on immigration is on pieces of legislation that have bedeviled Congress for more than a decade. The House passed the DREAM Act and an agricultural workers bill last week. The Senate has introduced compliment legislation to tackle the issues as well. But despite optimism from Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, that he's ""close"" to getting the Republican support he needs for the DREAM Act, GOP aides in moderate offices and in leadership CNN is talking to say that is not the case. Durbin would need 10 Republicans to sign on and many of them are requiring that any passage of the DREAM Act come with robust border security.
Trading a pathway to citizenship for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for more money for the border is going to be a hard sell for some Democrats, especially those on the left and in the progressive caucus in the House. The balancing act here is profound, and the Democratic caucus isn't even entirely united on the strategy for immigration reform. In the House, members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus were taken aback by Durbin's comments last week that comprehensive immigration reform wasn't happening this Congress after a group of them led by Rep. Linda Sanchez, a California Democrat, worked to write legislation and education members in the caucus. A hearing was scheduled on the bill and members were continuing their work. Tonight, the CHC will meet with Durbin in an effort to get on the same page.
Filibuster
As CNN reported Monday, this robust discussion about the future of the filibuster isn't going to start in a serious way until after Democrats' see multiple pieces of legislation go down because of it. 
Yes, Manchin and Biden have talked about a talking filibuster. But the reality is that if you don't get rid of the 60-vote threshold at the end of all that talking, all you do is create a scenario where Republicans can control the floor at length and halt your entire agenda every time someone objects to something. The talking filibuster could backfire for Democrats unless the 60-vote threshold is scraped, which Manchin has said repeatedly he won't do. Even if the filibuster is disposed of, it also doesn't clear the way for progressives to pass their agenda. You still have a dynamic Democratic caucus in the Senate where you have to convince your most moderate members every time to get on board. If you get rid of the filibuster, you don't all of a sudden pass an assault weapons ban, comprehensive immigration reform and the rest. It takes time, convincing and a lot of questions about Democratic unity.
Manchin isn't the only one. Yes, some members are opening the door in ways we haven't seen. And yes, a few major defeats could force the issue to a place where we haven't been before. But, we aren't there yet. And just because Manchin is the only member talking about not wanting to abandon the 60-vote threshold, doesn't mean he's the only one. There are likely plenty of others.
Minimum wage
This was the perfect example of a place where Manchin and Arizona Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema were talking about their opposition, but it turned out the resistance to raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour was far greater than just two members. When the Senate voted last month on this amendment to the Coronavirus relief bill, eight Democrats voted against it, many of whom we had never heard from before publicly. 
Later Tuesday, members of that group will meet to discuss what kind of minimum wage they could get behind. There are a myriad of ideas being floated from regional minimum wages that would take the economic conditions of a state into account before assigning a minimum wage to simply smaller dollar increases. The point is that raising the minimum wage isn't off the table, it just would have to be a smaller number to actually pass and garner some Republican votes.
","In the opening months of Joe Biden's presidency, Congress' job was crystal clear: Pass a relief bill and get it signed into law.  The understanding was that every other priority: guns, immigration, infrastructure, climate and voting rights could wait on Capitol Hill.

When can we go on a cruise again?,23/3/2021,,"It's been a year since the cruise industry was in the eye of the Covid storm as leisure ships proved themselves ideal places for the disease to spread. On March 13 last year, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a no-sail order for ships plying American waters while major industry body Cruise Lines International Association voluntarily suspended all operations.  The resulting scramble to get passengers and crew members home dragged on for several months. Ports closed their doors to virus-hit vessels, on-board Covid cases spiraled and when passengers were returned home, crew members still stuck at sea were hit by a mental health crisis. Today, the multi-billion dollar industry remains in limbo. While recent vaccine rollouts have brought optimism and, in some countries, Covid numbers are finally going down after a devastating second wave, international travel remains curtailed. Most of the world's major cruise lines have canceled voyages until the northern hemisphere summer -- and there remain question marks over what cruising in the wake of Covid will look like. Attempts to bring cruising back in certain markets have so far yielded mixed results. While it's hard to know exactly when and how the world will reopen, here's what we do know about the future of cruising. What are cruise lines and countries saying? Right now, most of the world's major cruise lines remain out of action. In Europe, some operations cautiously recommenced operations last summer -- including MSC Cruises and Costa Cruise Line. Both cruise companies ran Italian voyages with strict Covid protocols, but sailings were canceled when a second wave of Covid-19 hit Europe over winter months.  MSC recommenced voyages on its Grandiosa ship at the end of January 2021 and plans to start another European-only cruise on MSC Seaside in May. Meanwhile, Costa Cruises plans to restart its Italian sailings on March 27, 2021. Both will cater only to passengers living within the European Union's Schengen zone.  AIDA Cruises -- owned by Carnival Corporation -- is due to restart cruises around the Canary Islands in March 2021. In the US, the CDC no-sail order was lifted in October 2020 and detailed regulations were subsequently announced for how cruising could return to US waters, including running ""simulated voyages"" designed ""to replicate real world on board conditions of cruising."" The CDC rules were announced before the vaccine rollout gathered speed, so are focused on preventive measures including pre-boarding testing. Reliance on testing came under question when seven passengers tested positive for Covid-19 aboard the 112-guest SeaDream 1 cruise ship, the first vessel to sail in the Caribbean since the pandemic began. The CDC's official guidance is still that ""all people"" should avoid travel on cruise ships. It's regulations for cruising's return remain in effect until November 1, 2021. ""Returning to passenger cruising is a phased approach and our current focus is on the protection of crew and working with cruise lines to implement the initial phase requirements of testing all crew and developing onboard laboratory capacity,"" a CDC spokesperson told CNN Travel. They said there was no date for when simulated voyages would begin.  In the UK, a governent ""global travel taskforce"" is working to determine when international travel to and from the UK can restart, with the official roadmap stipulating it should be no earlier than May 17.  Some UK-based cruise lines plan to run domestic voyages this summer, in lieu of globe-spanning itineraries, including Viking Cruises, Fred Olsen Cruise Lines and P&O. P&O Cruises, owned by cruising giant Carnival, is set to offer ""cruises to nowhere"" for vaccinated UK travelers this summer. The voyages will depart from the southern port of Southampton, England from June until September, and navigate the UK coast. P&O said exact routes for each sailing will be determined on the day depending on weather. Princess Cruises has said its longer cruises departing the UK are canceled until the end of September, and instead will launch a series of ""new short cruises"" departing from the UK port of Southampton on its Regal Princess and Sky Princess vessels. P&O and Cunard have also announced plans for ""staycation sailings"" departing from the UK. Australia, which has adopted a hardline on arrivals throughout the pandemic, has a cruise ship ban in place until June 17, 2021.  Canada, meanwhile, has extended its cruise ship veto until February 2022. In Singapore, Royal Caribbean is due to restart so-called ""cruises to nowhere"" -- which previously took place in December 2020 on the Quantum of the Seas cruise ship -- in March. Royal Caribbean will also start Caribbean voyages on its Celebrity Millennium vessel from June. All crew and all adult guests will need to be vaccinated, while children must have had a negative PCR test within 72 hours of boarding. Each voyage will start and end in St Maarten, with stop offs including Aruba and Barbados.  Also from June, Royal Caribbean's Adventure of the Seas will set sail from Nassau in the Bahamas, stopping off at Royal Caribbean's private island, as well as Grand Bahama Island and Cozumel in Mexico. Guests will need to be vaccinated, as will staff, while children under 18 will need a negative Covid test to board. Roger Frizzell, a spokesman for Carnival Corporation -- which own Princess Cruises alongside Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, P&O Cruises, Cunard, Princess and Holland America --  told CNN Travel the cruise company will take ""a staggered approach"" to returning ""with a limited number of our ships cruising initially."" ""In the US, we do not yet have dates for when our brands will be able to begin cruising again. We are waiting on additional technical specifications from the CDC that are expected soon,"" said Frizzell. He added Carnival was ""hopeful that all of our fleet will be sailing again by the end of the year."" MSC Cruises has paused all US based sailings until April 30, 2021. Norwegian Cruise Line has suspended sailings until May 31, 2021. A Norwegian spokesperson told CNN Travel that the cruise line was currently working through its return to service plan in order to meet CDC requirements. Royal Caribbean International -- owner of Royal Caribbean Cruise Line, Celebrity Cruises and Silvesea -- has halted most sailings until May 31, 2021. The exceptions to this are the Quantum of the Seas which is sailing Singapore-based cruises to nowhere and also Spectrum of the Seas and Voyager of the Seas China sailings, which are due to restart on April 30. Royal Caribbean is also planning an inaugural cruise for its brand new ship Odyssey of the Seas departing from Israel in May to sail to the Greek islands and Cyprus. This voyage requires that all crew and passengers over the age of 16 will be vaccinated. In Israel, more than 50% of the population has received both doses of a vaccine. What about vaccines? When British operator Saga Cruises became the first cruise line to introduce a vaccinated passengers only requirement in January 2020, the decision prompted much speculation as to whether the rest of the industry will follow suit. Since then, US operator Crystal Cruises has also said all guests must be fully vaccinated before boarding future Crystal cruises. ""Guests will need to provide proof of vaccination before embarkation and must have received both doses of the vaccine if recommended by the manufacturer by that timeline,"" a statement from Crystal Cruises says. Royal Caribbean's plans for Odyssey of the Seas' Israel voyage, Adventure of the Seas' Caribbean trip and Celebrity Millennium's Caribbean itinerary further cements the notion that vaccinations will be the key to unlocking the industry. It's not clear how travelers will prove that they've been vaccinated, although Israel has been trialling a green pass system that allows vaccinated Israelis entry into restaurants or theaters. CLIA spokesperson Julie Green told CNN Travel that her organization, which represents 95% of ocean-going cruise liners, believes ""vaccinations should co-exist with testing regimes and other protocols and be considered as a progressive enhancement to responsible travel."" ""No single measure alone is effective, and a multi-layered approach is the right one to mitigate risk,"" she said. Norwegian Cruise Line has also said ""all crew members be vaccinated before boarding."" Virgin Voyages, Richard Branson's yet-to-be-inaugurated cruise line, has also said that its cruises will only accommodate vaccinated passengers and crew. ""We know the future is about vaccinations,"" said Tom McAlpin, president and CEO of Virgin Voyages in a statement. What will it be like on board? When the MSC Grandiosa returned to the waters last August, the voyage was characterized by Covid testing, social distancing, hand sanitizing and temperature checks. The ship was also operating at reduced capacity. Day trips were strictly moderated, and rule-breaking wasn't tolerated. Travelers and crew members were tested before boarding via a primary antigen test and a secondary molecular test. On board, cleaning methods were enhanced, including hospital-grade disinfectant and the use of UV-C light technology. CDC requirements, meanwhile, suggest future cruises will require on-board face coverings, hand hygiene and social distancing. Laboratory testing will also take place for all passengers and crew when they embark and disembark the ship. The mock cruises that must take place before ""official"" cruises depart will test the efficacy of these preventative measures.  According to CDC guidelines, each cruise line will have to send a report after the mock cruise is complete, which the CDC will then review, give feedback and issue a Covid-19 Conditional Sailing Certificate, assuming all requirements have been met. It's possible a series of mock cruises might need to take place. The goal, according to the CDC conditional sail order, is ""a return to passenger voyages in a manner that mitigates the risk of Covid-19 introduction, transmission, or spread among passengers and crew on board ships and ashore to communities."" CLIA's Julie Green told CNN Travel that it is establishing protocols that its ocean-going cruise line members will be required to follow. She points to on-board regulations implemented on recent European cruises as a sign of what's to come. ""Measures include robust screening, 100% testing, expanded cleaning and sanitation; and comprehensive shipboard prevention, surveillance, and response measures,"" Green says.  She added that all measures will be ""be continuously evaluated against the state of the global pandemic and may change over time as circumstances evolve. We continue to be guided by the knowledge of the scientific and medical communities."" How safe are cruises? The susceptibility of cruise ships to the spread of infectious dise",travel,TRAVEL
Boston Marathon Terror Attack Fast Facts,23/3/2021,"Facts
The bombs exploded 12 seconds apart near the marathon's finish line on Boylston Street.
According to Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office, the bombs contained BB-like pellets and nails.
The bombs were contained in pressure cookers, hidden inside backpacks, according to the FBI.
Victims
Martin Richard, 8, a student at Neighborhood House Charter School in Boston.
Krystle Campbell, 29, of Medford, Massachusetts.
Lingzi Lu, a graduate student at Boston University. She was originally from China.
Timeline
April 15, 2013 - At approximately 2:50 p.m., two bombs explode near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. The bombs explode within 8-12 seconds of each other, about 50-100 yards apart.
 At 6:10 p.m., President Barack Obama speaks to reporters at the White House, ""We will find out who did this. We'll find out why they did this. Any responsible individuals, any responsible groups, will feel the full weight of justice.""
April 16, 2013 - Obama, speaking at the White House, describes the bombings as an act of terrorism. 
Officials confirm that there were only two bombs, despite earlier reports that other unexploded devices had been found.
Authorities, including bomb experts, search an apartment in Revere, Massachusetts, and remove items. Officials caution that there are no clear suspects and the motive remains unknown.
April 17, 2013 - A federal law enforcement official tells CNN that the lid to a pressure cooker thought to have been used in the bombings has been found on a rooftop at the scene.
Purported miscommunication between government officials lead several news organizations, including CNN, to report prematurely that a suspect has been arrested and is in custody.
April 18, 2013 - Attorney Kenneth Feinberg, an expert on victim compensation, is announced as the administrator of the One Fund Boston, a fund to assist individuals affected by the attacks.
At a press conference, the FBI releases pictures of the suspects they are seeking in connection with the bombings. The suspects are later identified as brothers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19.
Late in the evening, Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier is shot and killed on campus. Soon after, Tsarnaev brothers carjack a driver in Cambridge. The driver is released about 30 minutes later. 
As the police chase them, Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev throw explosives out the windows and exchange gunfire with officers. Tamerlan is wounded and later dies at Beth Israel Hospital. He had bullet wounds and injuries from an explosion, according to officials.
April 19, 2013 - Boston police identify the bombers as Tamerlan Tsarnaev and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, brothers from Cambridge, Massachusetts. They are of Chechen origin and legally immigrated to the United States. Tamerlan is identified as the person killed in the encounter with police while Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a student at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, remains at large.

US and allies announce sanctions against Chinese officials for 'serious human rights abuses' against Uyghurs,23/3/2021,"The announcement was part of a broader show of unity by the US and its international allies, all voicing condemnation for Beijing's repression of Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang province.
In a carefully orchestrated series of statements, the US and allies in Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific created a unified show of force, announcing sanctions and issuing condemnations seemingly meant to isolate and pressure Beijing. The EU announced its own sanctions, followed by the US designations and then a joint statement from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the foreign ministers of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance made up of the US, the UK, Australian, Canada and New Zealand. 
""The evidence, including from the Chinese Government's own documents, satellite imagery, and eyewitness testimony is overwhelming. China's extensive program of repression includes severe restrictions on religious freedoms, the use of forced labor, mass detention in internment camps, forced sterilizations, and the concerted destruction of Uyghur heritage,"" the joint statement said. All five countries had taken action alongside the EU, the statement said.
The US designated Wang Junzheng, the Secretary of the Party Committee of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and Chen Mingguo, Director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau. ""These individuals are designated pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13818, which builds upon and implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and targets perpetrators of serious human rights abuse and corruption,"" the Treasury Department said.
""Chinese authorities will continue to face consequences as long as atrocities occur in Xinjiang,"" said the Treasury Department's Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control Andrea M. Gacki. ""Treasury is committed to promoting accountability for the Chinese government's human rights abuses, including arbitrary detention and torture, against Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities.""
Blinken described the Chinese campaign against Uyghurs as genocide. 
""Amid growing international condemnation, the PRC continues to commit genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang,"" Blinken said in a statement, using the acronym for the People's Republic of China. ""The United States reiterates its calls on the PRC to bring an end to the repression of Uyghurs, who are predominantly Muslim, and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang, including by releasing all those arbitrarily held in internment camps and detention facilities.""
The coordinated sanctions announcement comes days after a heated clash between Blinken, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and senior Chinese officials prompted by US objections to Beijing's human rights abuses, its territorial aggression and coercive economic practices.
'Solidarity'
Blinken emphasized last week that the US was also expressing the concerns of allies, and indicated that going forward, Washington would act in concert with them as well, an approach that US officials say is more effective than targeting China one-on-one.  
On Monday, he said that the US had ""taken this action today in solidarity with our partners in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union ... These actions demonstrate our ongoing commitment to working multilaterally to advance respect for human rights and shining a light on those in the PRC government and CCP responsible for these atrocities.""  
The Treasury Department said in a statement that, ""complementary actions using these global human rights sanctions regimes enable likeminded partners to form a unified front to identify, promote accountability for, and disrupt access to the international financial system by those who abuse human rights.""  
Also Monday, The US announced a second set of coordinated sanctions with the European Union, designating to sanction Myanmar military officials and two military units for its violent repression of democratic protests there. 
And in a dramatic display of international solidarity against repressive Chinese practices, diplomats from more than two dozen countries gathered Monday to try to gain access to a Chinese court Monday as detained Canadian Michael Kovrig went on trial in Beijing on espionage charges. They were denied. 
Politico was first to report the US was set to unveil sanctions.
The European Union announced its sanctions Monday, naming Zhu Hailun, former head of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), and three other top officials, for overseeing the detention and indoctrination program targeting Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, they said, according to the Official Journal of the European Union.  
Tit-for-tat for response
China responded almost immediately with tit-for-tat penalties, announcing sanctions on Monday against 10 EU politicians and four entities for ""maliciously spreading lies and disinformation."" They will be banned from entering mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, while their related companies and institutions are restricted from doing business with China, it said.
David Sassoli, president of the European Parliament, said Monday that China's sanctions on MEPs, the Human Rights Subcommittee and EU bodies are ""unacceptable and will have consequences.""
The European Commission Vice President for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Affairs High Representative Josep Borrell said Monday that China's retaliatory sanctions against EU officials are ""regrettable and unacceptable.""
""Rather than change its policies and address our legitimate concerns, China has again turned a blind eye, and these measures are regrettable and unacceptable,"" he said during a news conference in Brussels on Monday. Borrell pointed to China's sanctions against ""members of the European Parliament, scholars, and entities with a political and security committee, the Subcommittee on human rights, as well as to national foundations"" and said, ""This is something that we consider unacceptable, it doesn't answer our legitimate concerns.""
Borrell went on to reiterate that China's action will not change ""the European Union's determination to defend human rights and to respond to serious violations and abuses,"" calling on Beijing to engage in dialogue on Human Right's issues, instead of continuing to be ""confrontational.""
""Human rights are inalienable rights,"" Sassoli said. 
The EU said that Zhu Hailun had been described as the ""architect"" of this Uyghur indoctrination program, and ""is therefore responsible for serious human rights violations in China, in particular large-scale arbitrary detentions inflicted upon Uyghurs and people from other Muslim ethnic minorities.""
The sanctions marked the first time the EU has targeted China with its Human Rights sanctioning regime, which came into force in December 2020 and was first used over the poisoning of Alexei Navalny. 
'Grossly interfering'
In a statement posted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, China accused the EU of ""disregarding and distorting the facts"" and ""grossly interfering in China's internal affairs"" by imposing sanctions against its officials.  
The Chinese individuals listed by the EU are now subject to an asset freeze and will be banned from travelling to the EU. The sanctions also bar any EU persons and entities from making funds available, either directly or indirectly, to those listed. 
The EU said Zhu Hailun was ""responsible for maintaining internal security and law enforcement in the XUAR. As such, he held a key political position in charge of overseeing and implementing a large-scale surveillance, detention and indoctrination program targeting Uyghurs and people from other Muslim ethnic minorities."" 
Zhu is the former secretary of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), former Deputy Secretary of the XUAR Party Committee, and former Deputy Head of the regional legislative body, according to the Official Journal of the European Union.
Three other Xinjiang officials were sanctioned: Wang; Deputy Secretary of the XUAR Party Committee, Wang Mingshan; and Chen Mingguo, Director of the Xinjiang Public Security Bureau. 
Apart from the European 10 politicians, China also sanctioned four entities included the Political and Security Committee of the Council of the European Union, Subcommittee on Human Rights of the European Parliament, the Mercator Institute for China Studies, and the Alliance of Democracies Foundation. 
""The Chinese government is firmly determined to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests,"" the statement added. ""The Chinese side urges the EU side to reflect on itself, face squarely the severity of its mistake and redress it. It must stop lecturing others on human rights and interfering in their internal affairs."" 
","The US announced sanctions Monday against two Chinese officials for ""serious human rights abuses"" against Uyghur Muslims, a step coordinated with allies including the European Union, Canada and the United Kingdom, which imposed sanctions on the same individuals and others, the Treasury Department said.

Could China's aggressive Xinjiang sanctions counter-punch risk alienating the European Union?,23/3/2021,"China, at least, will be able to boast of hitting back: following new sanctions announced by the European Union on Monday, Beijing introduced countermeasures against multiple European lawmakers and academics. 
From China's perspective, such sanctions are only fair, a tit-for-tat response that sends a message to the domestic audience that Beijing will not take such challenges laying down. But they're also a gamble that European policymakers will see the punitive measures as a piece of theater, not aggression, and will be willing to look past the designation of some of their colleagues, in continuing to build economic ties with Beijing. 
The potential cost for China in overplaying their hand here is relatively high: not only could a misstep jeopardize a forthcoming investment agreement with the EU, currently in its final stages, but it may also push the bloc closer to Washington, following the alienation of the Donald Trump era that so benefited Beijing. 
Soon after the Chinese sanctions were announced, the Socialists and Democrats -- the second-largest grouping of lawmakers in the European Parliament -- said they would not engage in any talks on the agreement until the measures are lifted. 
Seven years in the making, the wide-ranging agreement, known formally as the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment with China, is designed to rebalance trade with the world's second largest economy and improve market access for EU businesses. 
""Europe needs to trade with China, but our values and standards go first,"" said Inmaculada Rodr┴guez-Pi?ero, a Spanish lawmaker and S&D member. ""We stand by our principles and we will defend our principles.""
Some in China (and elsewhere) will no doubt see hypocrisy in such reactions, a sign of how the Europeans can dish it out but can't take it. But many in Europe will likely see a difference between sanctions targeting regional Chinese officials and entities accused of ""serious human rights abuses,"" and measures going after individual European lawmakers let alone academics and think tanks. 

Aggressive response
Those targeted by the European sanctions include Chinese officials responsible for Xinjiang. The US State Department accuses Beijing of detaining up to 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in camps in the far western region, and subjecting them to forced labor and other abuses. Also sanctioned was the state-run Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, which has been accused of being a major recipient of forced labor. 
China has consistently denied allegations of human rights abuses, arguing the camps are necessary to prevent religious extremism and terrorism.
The EU was joined by the United Kingdom, US and Canada, and the countries said in a joint statement the ""coordinated action"" was intended to send a clear message to China ""to end its repressive practices."" They stopped short of targeting any senior officials, however, arguably not going as far even as previous US sanctions over Hong Kong and Xinjiang. 
For its part, China imposed sanctions against 10 European politicians and four bodies it accused of ""maliciously spreading lies and disinformation"" and ""grossly interfering in China's internal affairs"" by doing so. 
They will be banned -- along with their families -- from entering China, Hong Kong and Macao, and any related companies or institutions restricted from doing business in China. 
""The Chinese side urges the EU side to reflect on itself, face squarely the severity of its mistake and redress it. It must stop lecturing others on human rights and interfering in their internal affairs,"" Beijing said in a statement. 
Among those sanctioned are two think tanks, the conservative, pro free market Alliance of Democracies Foundation, and the Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS), one of the continent's leading China-focused institutions and not somewhere known for being particularly hawkish towards Beijing. 
In a statement, MERICS said it ""very much regrets this decision and rejects the allegation."" 
""As an independent research institute, we are dedicated to foster a better and more differentiated understanding of China,"" the statement added. ""We will continue to pursue this mission by presenting fact-based analysis, also with the aim of creating opportunities for exchanges and dialogue -- even in difficult times."" 
Also sanctioned was the German academic Adrian Zenz, one of the earliest researchers to raise the alarm over the situation in Xinjiang, who has previously been hit by lawsuits in China and subjected to a barrage of negative press over his work. 

Tit-for-tat
Speaking Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said ""for a long period, the US and the West wantonly interfered in other countries' domestic affairs by using democracy and human rights as an excuse."" 
Hua hailed the China-Russia relationship as a ""pillar for world peace and stability"" for the way the two countries have stood ""together in close cooperation, firmly reject(ing) hegemony and bullying practice."" 
That relationship was built partly on the back of sanctions introduced following Moscow's annexation of Crimea, a move which outraged the international community and pushed Russia closer to China. 
But Russia's alienation from much of Europe could also be a lesson for China, that repairing relations on the continent can be hard work. This was a lesson US President Joe Biden learned to his chagrin, after Washington's overtures to Brussels following his victory over Donald Trump were not welcomed as gladly as some in the US had expected. 
China was the major beneficiary of Trump's so-called America first foreign policy, with the EU increasingly plotting a separate tack to that followed by Washington. While the sanctions this week might appear like Brussels is following the lead of the US, that they were not as strong as American measures suggests there is still a great desire among many EU policymakers to continue to engage with China. 
Sanctions are an act of aggression and Beijing is of course entitled to respond to the EU measures how it sees fit -- it may even feel obliged to counter for a domestic audience. But by targeting widely respected think tanks and individual lawmakers, China may have risked hardening Europe's resolve. 
""China's sanctions on MEPs [Members of the European Parliament], the Human Rights Subcommittee and EU bodies are unacceptable and will have consequences,"" David Sassoli, President of the European Parliament, said following Beijing's announcement. Meanwhile, Manfred Weber, leader of the European People's Party, the largest grouping in the legislature, said the moves ""shows us the contempt Beijing has for democracy."" 
And while the very human rights abuses the EU is now targeting with sanctions were not enough to dissuade it from seeking increased trade with China, the targeting of its own lawmakers could tip the balance. 
""China just killed the EU-China Investment Agreement by sanctioning the people criticising the slave labour/genocide in Xinjang,"" said Guy Verhofstadt MEP, the chair of the conference on the future of Europe.
But while all eyes will now be on the agreement, there are also other ways lawmakers on the continent could respond that would anger China. Reacting to the news he would not be allowed to visit China, Macao or Hong Kong, sanctioned MEP Reinhard B┨tikofer tweeted ""But then there is Taiwan. :-)"" 
","When Chinese and Russian officials meet in Beijing this week, one topic of conversation may be the hatred both countries have for the international community's use of sanctions to interfere in what they regard as ""internal affairs.""

"5 things to know for March 23: Boulder, Covid-19, Israel, White House, China",23/3/2021,"Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 
(You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)
1. Colorado shooting
Ten people, including a police officer, were killed yesterday afternoon after a gunman opened fire in a grocery store in Boulder, Colorado. The attack unfolded just before 3 p.m. local time as customers in the King Soopers store waited in line for Covid-19 vaccines and shopped. Among those killed was 51-year-old Officer Eric Talley, who was the first police officer to respond. Police haven't released details about the rest of the victims yet. A suspect is in custody, but so far police have declined to comment on his identity, a motive or the specific weapon. A senior law enforcement source said the shooter used an AR-15-style rifle. The shooting comes just days after another mass murderer took the lives of eight people at spas around Atlanta. Together, these tragedies have renewed calls for stricter gun control legislation.

2. Coronavirus?
The AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is gaining steam after the company released new data on its efficacy. A US-based clinical trial showed the vaccine had 79% efficacy against symptomatic disease and 100% efficacy against severe disease and hospitalization, though an independent US board expressed concern over whether the data is complete. Still, the Biden administration will loan about 4 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses to Canada and Mexico as the shots await approval in the US. South Korea's President just got the AstraZeneca vaccine himself, and starting today, adults age 65 and older across his country can, too. While there's still concern that travel and mass gatherings could feed another surge in the US, experts estimate vaccine usage has already saved about 40,000 American lives.

3. Israel?
Israelis head to the polls today for the country's fourth general election in under two years. Political leaders have failed to form a decisive government after the last three elections, and there's no guarantee this one will be any different. Most likely, the vote will chiefly serve as a referendum on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Though he's won praise for recent diplomatic deals and his handling of the pandemic, the country's leader of 15 years is also on trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust. While Netanyahu's Likud party will likely come out on top this time, polls show as many as 13 parties could win spots in the 120-seat Knesset, which would make forming a cohesive government all the more difficult.

4. White House
White House advisers are expected to present a two-part, $3 trillion jobs and infrastructure proposal to President Biden as soon as this week. The massive plan is part of the economic agenda Biden promised during his campaign and represents the second phase of his ""rescue"" and ""recovery"" strategy (after the coronavirus relief bill). One part of the new plan focuses on infrastructure and clean energy, and the other on what's being termed the ""care economy"" -- things like early education and child care. No final decisions have been made on the plan, but Biden says he will work with congressional Democrats to find the best way forward.

5. China
The US and several international allies?announced coordinated sanctions against two Chinese officials for ""serious human rights abuses"" against Uyghur Muslims. The announcement, in cooperation with the European Union, Canada and the United Kingdom and others, is a collective motion of condemnation for Beijing's repression of Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang province. China hit right back, announcing sanctions against 10 EU politicians and four entities for ""maliciously spreading lies and disinformation."" This recent volley will likely be a big topic of conversation when Chinese and Russian officials meet in Beijing this week, since both countries are bitter over sanctions from the international community.

Chinese markets slump as tit-for-tat sanctions raise tension with US and Europe,23/3/2021,"Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index (HSI) was Asia's worst performer, closing down 1.3%, after recovering slightly from a tumble of more than 3% earlier in the day. China's Shanghai Composite (SHCOMP) index fell 0.9%. The rest of the region also struggled: South Korea's Kospi (KOSPI) and Japan's Nikkei (N225) lost 1% and 0.6%, respectively.
""Investors' nerves were rattled"" by the sanctions, ""muddying the geopolitical waters,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at Oanda. 
Washington announced sanctions Monday against two Chinese officials for ""serious human rights abuses"" against Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. The European Union, Canada and the United Kingdom all imposed sanctions on the same individuals and others, a show of unity by the Western allies as they continued to voice condemnation over Beijing's treatment of Uyghurs in the region.
China denounced the moves and hit back against the European Union almost immediately, announcing its own sanctions against 10 EU politicians and four entities for ""maliciously spreading lies and disinformation.""
Guy Verhofstadt, a senior member of the European parliament, even said that China's decision to fire back had ""killed"" a major investment deal between Brussels and Beijing that has yet to be ratified. The deal, which has been in the works for years, is designed to rebalance trade with the world's second largest economy.
Soon after the Chinese sanctions were announced, the second-largest grouping of lawmakers in the European Parliament said they would not engage in any talks on the agreement until the measures are lifted.
The flare-up comes after what was already a tense few days. Talks between the United States and China in Alaska led to a tense confrontation late last week during what was the first in-person meeting between senior leaders on both sides since US President Joe Biden took office.
News of the sanctions fueled a particularly rough day for tech stocks in Hong Kong. The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks 30 large tech firms including Alibaba and Tencent, tumbled 2.6%. Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY) slipped 0.5% and 0.8% each. Meituan and Xiaomi lost 5.2% and 4.1%, respectively.
The market jitters also appeared to hurt Chinese internet giant Baidu, (BIDU) which launched a secondary listing in Hong Kong to a tepid response on its first day of trading Tuesday. 
The $3.1 billion listing for the company, which already trades in New York, underwhelmed. It finished the day at 252.20 Hong Kong dollars ($32.47), less than 1% above its offering price of 252 Hong Kong dollars ($32.45). It was the city's biggest secondary listing since JD.com (JD) raised $4 billion last June, according to data provider Refinitiv.
""Battle lines are getting drawn between [the] US and China around Internet technology dominance,"" said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist for Sydney-based online broker Axi. ""You need to think last week's less-than-amicable sitdown is probably holding some enthusiasm back as [the] US could continue to clamp down on Chinese technology.""

It's been 2 weeks since Texas lifted its mask mandate. Here's how business owners are handling it,23/3/2021,"Gov. Greg Abbott announced March 2 that he was lifting the mask mandate. A week later, businesses of all types were allowed to open to 100% capacity. On top of that, people who decide to not wear masks can't be punished by law, Abbott's mandate says. 
""It's amazing what people, what kind of people there are that will go out of their way to have their two cents put in that they're against having to wear a mask,"" said Wayne LaCombe, co-owner at Legends Diner in Denton, Texas. ""I would imagine that 75% of the calls that we get are because the mask mandate has been lifted.""
Businesses in Texas have now become a battleground of sorts for wearing masks. There's nothing -- legally -- telling people that they have to wear a mask inside. Private business, however, are still allowed to require masks at their discretion.
For business owners like LaCombe, who just want to keep their employees and customers safe, they tell CNN they've fielded vicious calls from strangers and some have even received death threats. 
""It's tough situation to be in, but we have to stand our ground,"" LaCombe said.
One example is a woman arrested earlier this month in Galveston a day after the mask mandate was lifted. She refused to wear a mask inside a bank but also refused to leave when asked. She was arrested and charged with trespassing.
As of Monday evening, Texas has more than 2.7 million Covid-19 cases and more than 47,000 deaths, according to data by Johns Hopkins University.
One owner says he's received threats
Mike Nguyen, owner of Noodle Tree restaurant in San Antonio, told CNN he's mentally, physically and emotionally drained. 
He said he's made 20 harassment and threat reports in the last week. And it's not just about the mask mandates, either. 
Eight people were fatally shot in Atlanta last week, feeding the flames of anti-Asian sentiment that's gotten out of control since the start of the pandemic. 
Anti-Asian hate crimes have more than doubled during the pandemic, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.
Nguyen saw this firsthand. His restaurant was vandalized last week with statements like ""Go Back 2 China"" and ""Kung Flu"" spray painted on the building. 
Nguyen also told CNN someone called him Thursday, stated his home address and told him they're coming. 
""You could tell the hate in the voice and the anger in it that it wasn't something like someone just trying to troll or play around. It was real. They meant it,"" he said. 
His employees have been harassed as well, enduring name-calling and getting cursed at by customers. 
Nguyen told CNN he doesn't believe the governor has done enough, despite Abbott announcing that there's no place for harassment and vandalism. 
""So all this stuff that's happening, all it's done for those who disagree with what I said, you've proven me right,"" Nguyen said. ""I said that it would escalate. I said that it would cause confrontation and it all has happened, you know? And it's gotten to this point.""
Yet, Nguyen says he does not resent the governor for lifting the mask mandate. 
""If something happens, the blood's on his hands,"" he said. 
'We're doing something right'
LaCombe, the co-owner of Legends Diner, told CNN Monday there have not been any physical confrontations or calls to police at his restaurant. 
""Everything's been just social media and phones and we hope it just stays that way,"" he said. 
Most of his clientele are people over the age of 50, a high-risk group for Covid-19. To show how serious his business was about wearing a mask, LaCombe put up a warning sign last week telling people they'd have to pay a $50 surcharge if he had to explain why masks are mandatory and a $75 if they disagreed. 
As of Monday, LaCombe says he has not had to charge anyone either surcharge. 
""If it becomes a need that someone is adamant about not wearing a face mask, we'll just exit them out of the restaurant,"" he said. ""Our main business decision was to let people know that we're safe."" 
That doesn't stop people from calling, though, to tell LaCombe and his employees they can't demand mask wearing. 
""By law they don't have to wear a mask. So we are, in context, infringing on their freedom,"" LaCombe said. ""And I'm sorry, I am not one to go out there and infringe on anyone's freedom, but your freedom is whether you want to come in here or not. That's your freedom.""
And his response to people who say they're chasing customers off? 
""Well, those are the customers we do not want in our diner,"" he said. ""We want the people that believe in safety and they are looking for a safe place to go.""
LaCombe did say that weeks ago, the constant phone calls did upset his wife and made him dread coming to work. Since then, though, he said he looks forward to the phone calls.
""We've been open since the pandemic started,"" he said. ""We have not had a single virus outbreak or reaction to the virus in our diner since we've been open and we have employees that haven't been vaccinated, so we're doing something right."" 
","Texas has been mask-free since the beginning of March, but it has created a standoff between business owners across the state trying to mitigate Covid-19 outbreaks and their customers. Gov. Greg Abbott announced March 2 that he was lifting the mask mandate. A week later, businesses of all types were allowed to open to 100% capacity. On top of that, people who decide to not wear masks can't be punished by law, Abbott's mandate says.  ""It's amazing what people, what kind of people there are that will go out of their way to have their two cents put in that they're against having to wear a mask,"" said Wayne LaCombe, co-owner at Legends Diner in Denton, Texas. ""I would imagine that 75% of the calls that we get are because the mask mandate has been lifted."" Businesses in Texas have now become a battleground of sorts for wearing masks. There's nothing -- legally -- telling people that they have to wear a mask inside. Private business, however, are still allowed to require masks at their discretion. For business owners like LaCombe, who just want to keep their employees and customers safe, they tell CNN they've fielded vicious calls from strangers and some have even received death threats.  ""It's tough situation to be in, but we have to stand our ground,"" LaCombe said. One example is a woman arrested earlier this month in Galveston a day after the mask mandate was lifted. She refused to wear a mask inside a bank but also refused to leave when asked. She was arrested and charged with trespassing. As of Monday evening, Texas has more than 2.7 million Covid-19 cases and more than 47,000 deaths, according to data by Johns Hopkins University. One owner says he's received threats Mike Nguyen, owner of Noodle Tree restaurant in San Antonio, told CNN he's mentally, physically and emotionally drained.  He said he's made 20 harassment and threat reports in the last week. And it's not just about the mask mandates, either.  Eight people were fatally shot in Atlanta last week, feeding the flames of anti-Asian sentiment that's gotten out of control since the start of the pandemic.  Anti-Asian hate crimes have more than doubled during the pandemic, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Nguyen saw this firsthand. His restaurant was vandalized last week with statements like ""Go Back 2 China"" and ""Kung Flu"" spray painted on the building.  Nguyen also told CNN someone called him Thursday, stated his home address and told him they're coming.  ""You could tell the hate in the voice and the anger in it that it wasn't something like someone just trying to troll or play around. It was real. They meant it,"" he said.  His employees have been harassed as well, enduring name-calling and getting cursed at by customers.  Nguyen told CNN he doesn't believe the governor has done enough, despite Abbott announcing that there's no place for harassment and vandalism.  ""So all this stuff that's happening, all it's done for those who disagree with what I said, you've proven me right,"" Nguyen said. ""I said that it would escalate. I said that it would cause confrontation and it all has happened, you know? And it's gotten to this point."" Yet, Nguyen says he does not resent the governor for lifting the mask mandate.  ""If something happens, the blood's on his hands,"" he said.  'We're doing something right' LaCombe, the co-owner of Legends Diner, told CNN Monday there have not been any physical confrontations or calls to police at his restaurant.

Popeyes is bringing its famous fried chicken to Britain,23/3/2021,"The company on Tuesday unveiled plans to open its first UK restaurant later this year, following successful launches in Spain and Switzerland, as it accelerates its expansion outside of the United States. It declined to comment on the exact timing or location of its UK debut but said it's targeting 350 restaurants in the country over the next 10 years.
""We are looking to many locations at this particular moment,"" Popeyes UK co-founder Elias Diaz Sese told CNN Business in an interview.

Popeyes ！ which recently opened in China and Sri Lanka ！ hopes to replicate its success in the United States, where it's been one of the fastest-growing restaurant brands. It sold 250 million fried chicken sandwiches in America in just one year, after launching the product in August 2019.
The popularity of the sandwich helped spark a fierce battle with rivals that continues to rage, as a growing number of fast-food chains such as McDonald's (MCD), Taco Bell and Wendy's (WEN) have launched their own versions. 
Wendy's is also launching in the United Kingdom this year after exiting the market in the early 2000s. The company will open five restaurants, including in Oxford, in 2021, with plans to scale rapidly, a spokesperson told CNN Business.

Sese believes now is the perfect time to launch the Popeyes brand in Britain, as it emerges from a time of ""hardship"" following the coronavirus pandemic. Popeyes is ""all about celebration, joy and bringing people together,"" he said. The United Kingdom has also seen a ""tremendous growth in terms of chicken over the last few years,"" Sese added. 
Popeyes will be up against stiff competition ！ and not only from big chains such as KFC and Nando's, the South African flame-grilled chicken brand beloved by British celebrities such as Adele and Ed Sheeran.
The United Kingdom also has thousands of independently owned fried chicken shops, many of which draw links to the American South through names such as Tennessee Express and Mississippi Fried Chicken.
But Popeyes ！ which is authentically southern, tracing its roots back to 1972 Louisiana ！ is confident that its slow-cooked, hand-battered buttermilk chicken will stand out from the crowd.
""Our brand is all about the quality of our food and we think that will put us in a very good position in the UK market,"" said David Shear, president international of Restaurant Brands International (RBI), which bought Popeyes in 2017 and also owns Burger King and Tim Hortons.
""You don't bring a cultural American icon into a country like the UK every day,"" added Sese, the Popeyes UK co-founder, who is a former RBI executive.
Popeyes will enter the UK market as part of a joint venture between Restaurant Brands International, Sese and Austrian family investment firm Ring International Holdings.
","Americans have spent the past year going absolutely wild over fried chicken sandwiches. Now, Popeyes hopes to bring the craze to the United Kingdom.

Start planning for a world with a lot less water,22/3/2021,"Furthermore, climate change is playing havoc with the water cycle, disrupting weather systems and rainfall patterns that deliver either too much or too little, and rarely where and when it is needed.
That is why the theme of this year's United Nations World Water Day is valuing water. This is about considering the value of water for our households, food, culture, health, education, economics and the integrity of our natural environment. This is important because there is a growing disconnect between the urgency of our water needs for its multiple uses and the resources available to address them.
This is not due to a lack of capital, expertise or solutions -- all three are available in abundance.
It is a failure of national and international foresight, planning and cooperation. With a better understanding of the multidimensional values of water, we will be better able to safeguard this critical resource for everyone's benefit.
Over the last year, we have seen how water is the connecting thread linking the myriad impacts of our health and climate crises. Billions of people on every continent face a future of increasing water scarcity. And the Covid-19 pandemic has worsened the situation.
At the onset of the pandemic, we were urged to wash our hands frequently -- an instruction that was difficult to obey in the crowded slums of Rio, Nairobi, Jakarta and Mumbai, and by the 3 billion people globally who lack access to basic hand-washing facilities.
In a world without water, food production stops, cities cease to function, economic activity grinds to a halt and greenery turns to desert. The World Economic Forum's 2020 Global Risks Report, published in January, ranks risks from water crises higher than either infectious diseases or food crises.
In 2021, we are experiencing all three at once, with Covid-19 claiming over 2.7 million lives worldwide so far and leading to a severe increase in global food insecurity impacting vulnerable households in almost every country.
The World Bank estimates an additional capital investment of $1 trillion will be required over the next 10 years to meet the needs of the 2.2 billion people who still lack access to safe drinking water today, and to treat the 80% of the effluent that currently goes untreated, polluting ecosystems and carrying waterborne diseases. 
Against a funding gap of more than $100 billion a year, the Global Center on Adaptation (or GCA), an international environmental organization that partners with the public and private sectors to accelerate action to tackle climate change, just under $10 billion was invested globally in 2018 to improve water and wastewater management.
This means water projects attracted less than 2% of the $546 billion of funding from governments, companies and households available to fight climate change in 2018. In National Climate Plans, which set out how countries intend to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, water projects hardly figure at all.
But there are reasons to be hopeful. First, water projects are beginning to figure prominently in National Adaptation Plans in countries such as China, Ghana and Bangladesh. These plans help communities identify and adapt to the impacts of climate change, such as water scarcity and droughts.
Major institutional investors and banks, through groups such as the Valuing Water Finance Task Force, are also increasingly playing a role in addressing water issues by catalyzing capital markets to value water as a financial risk and influencing companies to take action.
Funding for climate adaptation, however, attracts only a fraction of climate finance. This must change. 
Secondly, the fight against Covid-19, which is consuming huge amounts of money, is forcing us to think more strategically about where to invest scarce public resources. In a post-pandemic world, we must use what we are learning about the dynamics of interconnected systems to ""build forward better."" GCA, in its ""State and Trends in Climate Adaptation Report 2020"" identifies climate-smart adaptation initiatives that can help economies recover faster and better from the ravages of the pandemic by delivering triple wins for the economy, health, and climate.  
For example, a little-known fact is that wetlands such as the Flow Country in Scotland to the swamp forests in South East Asia can store twice as much carbon as forests, making them the most effective carbon sinks on Earth. Investing in nature-based solutions to restore wetland ecosystems offers multiple benefits in addition to trapping carbon emissions, including flood and drought mitigation, water purification and the protection of biodiversity.
Another opportunity is increasing wastewater treatment. Effluent that is released untreated not only carries diseases and pollutes our environment, but also ferments and releases dangerous greenhouse gases such as methane, which contributes to global warming.
Modern wastewater treatment plants use bacteria to break down organic matter. The byproduct, biogas, can be used for cooking, heating and cooling, and to generate renewable energy in waste-to-energy plants. Investing in wastewater treatment is therefore good for our health, our environment, the economy, and our climate.
One of the reasons why water initiatives are underfunded is that funding for building resilience, cutting carbon emissions and development often exists in silos. Harnessing resources from different finance pools is complicated. This is particularly true when water projects transcend national boundaries, like the current crisis.
Even at local and national levels, expertise to put together multi-sectoral project proposals is often lacking.
That is why GCA is mobilizing support for a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) to invest in building that local and national expertise by bringing innovation and prowess to investments made by multilateral development banks and other public and private financiers. Faster, better and smarter project preparation is needed to make water projects bankable and to drive investments at the speed and scale required. 
Water deserves a greater share of climate and development finance, and a much bigger role in our post-pandemic recoveries.
It underpins all 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, from fighting hunger and poverty, to building sustainable cities and achieving universal access to clean water and sanitation. There are so many practical ways to invest smartly in our water security. We urgently need to reexamine our priorities and make water the foundation of our health and economic recoveries.
","World leaders need to start planning for a world with a lot less water. The world's population consumes six times more of this life-sustaining element than our ancestors did 100 years ago, and with population and economic growth, demand continues to rise. Furthermore, climate change is playing havoc with the water cycle, disrupting weather systems and rainfall patterns that deliver either too much or too little, and rarely where and when it is needed.

Hate is haunting Asian Americans. Their fear underscores a racial reckoning that is far from over,22/3/2021,"Last week, six Asian women and two others were killed when a gunman opened fire at the spas. The suspect, a 21-year-old White man, has since claimed responsibility for the shootings and is facing multiple murder and firearms charges.  
The calls for investigators to consider hate crime charges as well as the outrage, sadness and fear among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have only grown amid an uptick in reported incidents against Asian communities in the US since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. But lawmakers and community leaders say racism against Asian Americans is nothing new.
The recent attacks shocked a deeply divided nation that has been continuously pushed to talk about the racism and inequity that plague its increasingly diverse demographic.   
For many, the attacks in Georgia were another example of how White supremacy continues shaping America. They came as Republicans try to roll back voting access or put new obstacles that could disproportionally impact voters of color in more than 40 states, and two months after insurrectionists stormed the United States Capitol. 
""Asian Americans are targets of this kind of hate and we need to realize that just because they may have an image of being, economically successful, well-educated or quiet, (it) does not mean that they are seen or accepted as 'full Americans',"" said Pawan Dhingra, a professor of American Studies at Amherst College who specializes in Asian American studies.
In the last year, Asian Americans have been the targets of verbal and physical assaults because of misguided coronavirus fears and after former President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to Covid-19 as ""China virus"" or ""kung flu."" The violence ranged from a cardiologist at a grocery store almost having her mask ripped off to a 84-year-old man from Thailand who died after being shoved to the ground during his morning walk.
Seeing the faces of the victims in the Atlanta-area spa shootings prompted fear beyond the Peach state in Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities.
""It's very difficult to describe this feeling of just like grieving, even if it's people you never knew or never heard of or never had contact with,"" said Ian, a 24-year-old writer who lives in New York.  ""Psychologically, it does a lot to your head to just hear about people being shot and killed because of how they look, because they look like my grandma, because they look like my mom.""
Ian, who says he has often been the target of racial slurs, is among the more than 300 Asian Americans who shared their stories with CNN.  
CNN is only using first names for their safety and to help prevent them from facing retribution in their communities. 
Nearly a week after the Atlanta-area shootings, the movement against anti-Asian hate continues to grow with protests in several cities, including Denver, New York and San Francisco. For Cynthia Choi, one of the founders of Stop AAPI Hate, the country is seeing a ""period of awakening."" 
""This is a moment that there is no denial that race and gender are factors in this tragedy,"" Choi said. 
In the past week, many lawmakers, experts and advocates have said there's a link between the anti-Asian sentiment, the Capitol riots and the ongoing voting right battle.
""In many parts of the country, some people want to have a more narrow definition of who truly belongs, of who truly has rights,"" Dhingra said.
Capitol rioters 'hated our skin color,' Black officer says 
When insurrectionists entered the Capitol in January, some were carrying Confederate flags and displayed signs and symbols of racist, White supremacist and extremist groups. A Black US Capitol Police officer said he and his fellow Black officers endured racist taunts. 
""The Black officer struggle was different as in, like I said, we fought against not just people that were, that hated what we represented, but they hate our skin color also,"" Harry Dunn told CNN's Don Lemon on CNN Tonight last week.  ""That's just a fact and they used those words to prove that, they showed that they hated us and they hated our skin color.""
The January 6 attack, which killed five people and injured more than 100 police officers, has left Black officers grappling with their experience. 
 ""Once I had time to sit down and put it all together, it was just so overwhelming: that here we are giving so much and putting our lives on the line to protect democracy and keep it and we're being called racial slurs, traitors, and any just weapon that these people could use because they were upset about something,"" he said.
Several lawmakers described the rioters as White supremacists in the days and weeks after the mob.
""Let us be clear, this was a domestic terror attack perpetrated by riotist mobs of White supremacists, armed equipped and many skilled in police and military tactics who came to overturn an election in which their candidate Trump lost,"" Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus said in a January hearing.
Wave of voting rights restrictions likened to Jim Crow era
A battle over voting rights has ensued across the country in recent weeks. Republicans are pushing for restrictions that Democrats and advocates argue would substantially impact people of color.
Lawmakers in 43 states have introduced more than 250 bills with restrictive voting provisions, according to a tally from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. Some of those proposed bills are in Florida, Arizona and Georgia, which were all battleground states in 2020 and host US Senate races in 2022. 
The proposed measures could limit Sunday voting and the number of ballot boxes, eliminate no-excuse absentee voting, ban automatic voter registration and prohibit volunteers from serving free food and drinks to people standing in line at the polls.
Voting rights advocates have said the measures are a direct attack on Black voters who showed up in unprecedented numbers for the presidential election.
In Georgia, lawmakers said in recent days that they plan to preserve Sunday early voting as part of the omnibus voting package that the House committee will take up this week. A previous bill sought to allow only one optional day of Sunday voting.
For Cliff Albright, the co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, the bill ""continues to be nothing but voter suppression.""
""The recent changes are nothing more than putting a little makeup and cologne on Jim Crow,"" Albright added. 
Voting rights activists had criticized that limit as attacking ""Souls to the Polls"" -- programs that help drive turnout among Black churchgoers, a key Democratic constituency. And a CNN analysis of voting patterns in November's general election found the measure eliminated days when a disproportionate number of Black voters had cast their ballots.
Stacey Abrams, the 2018 gubernatorial candidate cum voting activist, has slammed state voting bills across the country and also likened the Georgia efforts to ""a redux of Jim Crow, in a suit and tie.""
""The only connection that we can find is that more people of color voted, and it changed the outcome of elections in a direction that Republicans do not like,"" Abrams told CNN.
Voter suppression efforts along with the disparities in Covid-19 vaccine distribution, the surge of unaccompanied migrant children crossing the US-Mexico border and the anti-Asian assaults highlight some of the challenges that people of color in America constantly face. 
The country may have become the epicenter of a racial reckoning last summer but the flurry of recent events reveals those discussions are far from over.
","People laid flowers and prayed outside three spas in the Atlanta area while crowds across the country held signs declaring ""Stop Asian Hate"" in the days after the deadly shootings. Once again, America mourned the killings of people of color.   Last week, six Asian women and two others were killed when a gunman opened fire at the spas. The suspect, a 21-year-old White man, has since claimed responsibility for the shootings and is facing multiple murder and firearms charges.

""Asian Americans are targets of this kind of hate and we need to realize that just because they may have an image of being, economically successful, well-educated or quiet, (it) does not mean that they are seen or accepted as 'full Americans',"" said Pawan Dhingra, a professor of American Studies at Amherst College who specializes in Asian American studies. In the last year, Asian Americans have been the targets of verbal and physical assaults because of misguided coronavirus fears and after former President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to Covid-19 as ""China virus"" or ""kung flu."" The violence ranged from a cardiologist at a grocery store almost having her mask ripped off to a 84-year-old man from Thailand who died after being shoved to the ground during his morning walk. Seeing the faces of the victims in the Atlanta-area spa shootings prompted fear beyond the Peach state in Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities. ""It's very difficult to describe this feeling of just like grieving, even if it's people you never knew or never heard of or never had contact with,"" said Ian, a 24-year-old writer who lives in New York.  ""Psychologically, it does a lot to your head to just hear about people being shot and killed because of how they look, because they look like my grandma, because they look like my mom."" Ian, who says he has often been the target of racial slurs, is among the more than 300 Asian Americans who shared their stories with CNN.   CNN is only using first names for their safety and to help prevent them from facing retribution in their communities.  Nearly a week after the Atlanta-area shootings, the movement against anti-Asian hate continues to grow with protests in several cities, including Denver, New York and San Francisco. For Cynthia Choi, one of the founders of Stop AAPI Hate, the country is seeing a ""period of awakening.""  ""This is a moment that there is no denial that race and gender are factors in this tragedy,"" Choi said.  In the past week, many lawmakers, experts and advocates have said there's a link between the anti-Asian sentiment, the Capitol riots and the ongoing voting right battle. ""In many parts of the country, some people want to have a more narrow definition of who truly belongs, of who truly has rights,"" Dhingra said. Capitol rioters 'hated our skin color,' Black officer says  When insurrectionists entered the Capitol in January, some were carrying Confederate flags and displayed signs and symbols of racist, White supremacist and extremist groups. A Black US Capitol Police officer said he and his fellow Black officers endured racist taunts.  ""The Black officer struggle was different as in, like I said, we fought against not just people that were, that hated what we represented, but they hate our skin color also,"" Harry Dunn told CNN's Don Lemon on CNN Tonight last week.  ""That's just a fact and they used those words to prove that, they showed that they hated us and they hated our skin color."" The January 6 attack, which killed five people and injured more than 100 police officers, has left Black officers grappling with their experience.   ""Once I had time to sit down and put it all together, it was just so overwhelming: that here we are giving so much and putting our lives on the line to protect democracy and keep it and we're being called racial slurs, traitors, and any just weapon that these people could use because they were upset about something,"" he said. Several lawmakers described the rioters as White supremacists in the days and weeks after the mob. ""Let us be clear, this was a domestic terror attack perpetrated by riotist mobs of White supremacists, armed equipped and many skilled in police and military tactics who came to overturn an election in which their candidate Trump lost,"" Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus said in a January hearing. Wave of voting rights restrictions likened to Jim Crow era A battle over voting rights has ensued across the country in recent weeks. Republicans are pushing for restrictions that Democrats and advocates argue would substantially impact people of color. Lawmakers in 43 states have introduced more than 250 bills with restrictive voting provisions, according to a tally from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. Some of those proposed bills are in Florida, Arizona and Georgia, which were all battleground states in 2020 and host US Senate races in 2022.  The proposed measures could limit Sunday voting and the number of ballot boxes, eliminate no-excuse absentee voting, ban automatic voter registration and prohibit volunteers from serving free food and drinks to people standing in line at the polls. Voting rights advocates have said the measures are a direct attack on Black voters who showed up in unprecedented numbers for the presidential election. In Georgia, lawmakers said in recent days that they plan to preserve Sunday early voting as part of the omnibus voting package that the House committee will take up this week. A previous bill sought to allow only one optional day of Sunday voting. For Cliff Albright, the co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, the bill ""continues to be nothing but voter suppression."" ""The recent changes are nothing more than putting a little makeup and cologne on Jim Crow,"" Albright added.  Voting rights activists had criticized that limit as attacking ""Souls to the Polls"" -- programs that help drive turnout among Black churchgoers, a key Democratic constituency. And a CNN analysis of voting patterns in November's general election found the measure eliminated days when a disproportionate number of Black voters had cast their ballots. Stacey Abrams, the 2018 gubernatorial candidate cum voting activist, has slammed state voting bills across the country and also likened the Georgia efforts to ""a redux of Jim Crow, in a suit and tie."" ""The only connection that we can find is that more people of color voted, and it changed the outcome of elections in a direction that Republicans do not like,"" Abrams told CNN. Voter suppression efforts along with the disparities in Covid-19 vaccine distribution, the surge of unaccompanied migrant children crossing the US-Mexico border and the anti-Asian assaults highlight some of the challenges that people of color in America constantly face.  The country may have become the epicenter of a racial reckoning last summer but the flurry of recent events reveals those discussions are far from over.",us,US
Xiaojie Tan owned 2 spas and planned to retire soon. Then she became one of the Atlanta gunman's first victims,22/3/2021,"""I just want to hold her tight,"" Webb told CNN about her mother. ""Give her a hug ... hold her hand, hug her for a long time.""  
Four people were killed at Tan's Cherokee County spa. Four more were killed about an hour later at two spas some 30 miles away in Atlanta. Six of the victims were Asian women.
Tan met her ex-husband, Michael Webb, when he was on business in China.
The two married and moved in 2004 to Port St. Lucie, Florida, where Tan enrolled in nail school to get her license to be a nail technician.
The couple later moved to Marietta, Georgia, and Tan bought a nail salon. Known as Emily by many of her friends and clients, she later sold that and bought the Acworth spa and later a second spa, Webb said.
Webb described her as a hardworking woman who'd work seven days a week. 
Recently, Tan had told him she'd be able to retire soon. In the future, she hoped to travel, and wanted to visit Alaska and Europe.
""This was a massacre,"" Michael Webb said. ""We have a justice system and he'll have to be held accountable. And our family will be involved in that process as much as we can be.""
""We just want justice to be done and we're hopeful that it will be,"" he said.
Residents want killings labeled hate crimes
Residents and public health officials have called on investigators to consider hate crime charges against the suspect, whether on the basis of race or sex -- both of which are covered in Georgia's hate crime law.
""The acknowledgment that this was a crime built upon hatred for a particular community matters and I think that it's important that prosecutors and police consider that in making those charges,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told CNN on Saturday.
Jack Liang, the organizer of an anti-hate rally Sunday in New York City, said justice would not be served in his eyes if the suspect didn't face hate crime charges.
""He went to three different, separate locations, and he targeted these people,"" Liang said. ""And if it was another race, another type of hate crime, another person, would that be counted as a hate crime?""
These are the victims of violence 
The first shooting occurred at Youngs Asian Massage in Acworth shortly before 5 p.m. on March 16, authorities said. Four people were killed: 49-year-old Tan of Kennesaw; Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, of Acworth; Paul Andre Michels, 54, of Atlanta; and Daoyou Feng, 44. Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, of Acworth, was also shot but survived.
Within an hour after the first shooting, four Asian women were killed on Piedmont Road in Atlanta -- three at the Gold Massage Spa and one at the Aroma Therapy Spa across the street, authorities said. They were identified as Soon Chung Park, 74; Hyun Jung Grant, 51; Suncha Kim, 69; and Yong Ae Yue, 63, according to the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office.
One of the four victims in Atlanta was a South Korean citizen and permanent resident of the US, according to Kwangsuk Lee, South Korea's deputy consulate general in Atlanta. The other three are believed to be Americans of Korean ethnicity, Lee told CNN on Friday.
Yue's youngest son wrote on GoFundMe that his mom ""loved to introduce our family and friends to her home-cooked Korean food and Korean karaoke.""
""We are still in shock over the violent murder of our mother, but through our grieving we are making plans to memorialize her, bring our family together, and resolve her financial matters,"" he wrote.
On another GoFundMe page, one of Kim's grandchildren wrote in a post that she had come to the United States from South Korea and worked two to three jobs while speaking very little English.
""My grandmother was an angel, to have her taken away in such a horrific manner is unbearable to think about. As an immigrant, all my grandmother ever wanted in life was to grow old with my grandfather, and watch her children and grandchildren live the life she never got to live,"" the page says.
Meanwhile, a GoFundMe page dedicated to help the two sons of Grant, killed at the Gold Massage Spa in Atlanta, has raised more than $2.5 million.
""She was one of my best friends,"" her son, Randy Park, wrote on the page, ""and the strongest influence on who we are today.""
Georgia church revokes suspect's membership
The suspect, 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long, was arrested Tuesday night in a traffic stop 150 miles south of Atlanta.
Long told police he believed he had a sex addiction and that he saw the spas as ""a temptation ... that he wanted to eliminate,"" Cherokee County Sheriff's Office Capt. Jay Baker said on Wednesday. Long claimed the attacks weren't racially motivated, Baker added. But Atlanta police say it's still too early to know the suspect's motive.
Long is being held without opportunity for bail in Cherokee County, where he faces four counts of murder with malice, one count of attempted murder, one count of aggravated assault and five counts of using a firearm while committing a felony.
He has been charged with four counts of murder in connection with the two spa shootings in Atlanta, according to Atlanta police.
Cherokee County District Attorney Shannon Wallace said the investigation is ongoing and appropriate charges will be brought.
Long's church, Crabapple First Baptist Church, announced Sunday morning it had removed him from its memberships ranks, saying in a statement it could ""no longer affirm that he is truly a regenerate believer in Jesus Christ.""
Sunday's service opened with a church member reciting the names of the victims whose lives were taken in an ""inexcusable act of murder,"" Associate Pastor Luke Folsom said, according to a recording provided by the church.
""We have been grieving over this tragic loss of life all week, and we will continue to mourn for the victims and their families,"" Folsom said. ""So that's what we're going to do today.""
Rallies across the country
Amanda Pham, an Asian American woman living in Atlanta, told CNN this weekend that hateful comments directed towards her had increased recently, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. She described wearing a mask and someone asking her, ""Hey, are you going to give me the virus?""
""This isn't new,"" she said. ""It's been happening, it's increasingly happened over the past year, just (since) the start of the pandemic.""
Americans have gathered in rallies across the country this weekend to honor the victims and condemn violence against Asian Americans. 
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Atlanta Saturday, including Timothy Phan, a Florida resident who drove eight hours to attend. He told CNN the violence ""hits home.""
""I see my mother, I see my acquaintances, my colleagues,"" he said. ""This is an Asian issue but on top of that, this is more than that, this is a human issue.""
""We're in this struggle together,"" Henry Wong told CNN affiliate KGO at another rally this weekend in San Francisco. ""If we don't voice it now when will we?""
""One of the biggest problems in fighting hate crimes is that too many of the incidents are not recorded,"" California Assembly member Al Muratsuchi, who introduced a bill to establish a statewide hate crime hotline, told CNN. ""We want to make it as easy and safe as possible for people to report these incidents of hate crime.""
""The women who died, they looked just like me, they look like my mom, they look like my aunties,"" New York State Assembly member Yuh-Line Niou said Saturday during a rally in Manhattan. ""They look like us.""

US and allies sanction Myanmar's military for violent repression of protesters,22/3/2021,"The penalties were the second set that the US announced in coordination with allies on Monday. Earlier in the day, the US and European Union announced human rights sanctions against China for its ongoing repression in Xinjiang province, including of Uyghur Muslims. 
""The United States continues to call on the military regime to release all those unjustly detained; stop its attacks on civil society members, journalists, and labor unionists; halt the brutal killings by its security forces; and return power to the democratically elected government,"" Blinken said.
The US will designate Myanmar's chief of police, Than Hlaing, and its Bureau of Special Operations commander, Lt. Gen. Aung Soe, as well as two army units ""for being responsible for or complicit in or having directly or indirectly engaged or attempted to engage in, actions or policies that prohibit, limit, or penalize the exercise of freedom of expression or assembly by people in Burma,"" Blinken said in a statement, using another name for Myanmar. 
Members of one of the military units were among the security forces that fired live rounds into a crowd of protesters in the capital of Mandalay, and both units are ""part of the Burmese security forces' planned, systemic strategies to ramp up the use of lethal force,"" Blinken said.
""These designations show that this violence will not go unanswered,"" the top US diplomat said.
'Brutally repressing'
The EU sanctions targeted Myanmar's senior military officials, including the commander-in-chief, the deputy commander-in-chief, as well as an official who heads the election commission.
Blinken noted that the United Kingdom and Canada have also sanctioned many of the same individuals. 
""The United States, together with our allies and partners, has stood with them.  In response, the military regime continues its violent crackdown, which has killed at least 194 people to-date, including peaceful protesters,"" Blinken said. ""The junta continues its attempts to overturn the results of a democratic election by brutally repressing peaceful protesters and killing individuals who are simply demanding a say in their country's future.""
The military seized power after claiming that November 8 elections, which were decisively won by political leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, had been marred by fraud. After the country's election commission disputed that claim, the military replaced the commission. 
The coup marks a return to military rule, which stifled Myanmar for decades before a slim democratic opening began around 2010. As citizens of the country have taken to the streets to defend their election system with strikes and protests, the military has responded with increasing violence and efforts to stifle communications. Internet access has been restricted, journalists have been arrested and some newspapers have been barred from publishing.

Giant pandas 'on top form' mated 'multiple times' in French zoo,22/3/2021,,"A zoo in central France has announced that two of its giant pandas mated ""multiple times"" on Saturday. Huan Huan, a female, and Yuan Zi, a male, were put in contact eight times, at regular intervals, according to a press release from ZooParc de Beauval, published Sunday. Giant pandas have a very short window for breeding. Females are only able to become pregnant for 24 to 72 hours each year.  In April 2020, two pandas at a zoo in Hong Kong finally mated after 10 years of attempts, underlining the importance of each mating session. ZooParc de Beauval hailed its pandas' performance over the weekend. ""Huan Huan was at the top of her hormonal spike and Yuan Zi... was obviously on top form!"" reads the release. ""The two (bears) obviously had some rest periods during these vital hours... but they obviously weren't very tired."" Yuan Zi was ""more at ease"" during the act than in years past, according to the release, which noted that the pair were ""cooperative and rather active"" during their repeated encounters. ""Our male has made progress compared to last year,"" said Baptiste Mulot, head veterinarian at Beauval. ""He has a better idea of what to do."" While there is no guarantee that Huan Huan will in fact become pregnant, the zoo said the mating session was ""rather good,"" noting ""many high pitched noises"" from Huan Huan and ""more hoarse growling"" from Yuan Zi. Vets also artificially inseminated Huan Huan to improve the chances of her getting pregnant, the zoo said, and the team will have a better idea of whether the mating session was a success in around 15 days. The zoo has taken delivery of special bamboo shoots from China to ensure than Huan Huan gets all the nutrients she needs, as bamboo is out of season in France. Both pandas are 12 years old and have been in the French zoo since 2012. Huan Huan could become a mother for the second time, after giving birth to a male cub named Yuan Meng -- the first giant panda to be born in France -- 3.5 years ago. The gestation period for giant pandas ranges between 72 and 324 days.",travel,TRAVEL
"Archaeologists uncover 3,000-year-old gold mask in southwest China",22/3/2021,,"The remains of a gold mask are among a huge cache of 3,000-year-old artifacts found at an archaeological site in China's Sichuan province.  Weighing about 280 grams (0.6 pounds) and estimated to be made from 84% gold, the ceremonial mask is one of over 500 items unearthed from six newly discovered ""sacrificial pits,"" according to the country's National Cultural Heritage Administration. The finds were made at Sanxingdui, a 4.6-square-mile area outside the provincial capital of Chengdu. Some experts say the items may shine further light on the ancient Shu state, a kingdom that ruled in the western Sichuan basin until it was conquered in 316 BC.  In addition to the gold mask, archaeologists uncovered bronzes, gold foils and artifacts made from ivory, jade and bone. The six pits, of which the largest has a footprint of 19 square meters (205 square feet), also yielded an as-yet-unopened wooden box and a bronze vessel with owl-shaped patterning. More than 50,000 ancient artifacts have been found at Sanxingdui since the 1920s, when a local farmer accidentally came upon a number of relics at the site. A major breakthrough occurred in 1986, with the discovery of two ceremonial pits containing over 1,000 items, including elaborate and well-preserved bronze masks. After a long hiatus in excavations, a third pit was then found in late 2019, leading to the discovery of a further five last year. Experts believe the pits were used for sacrificial purposes, explaining why many of the items contained were ritually burned as they were dropped in and buried.  Independent civilization Sanxingdui is believed to have sat at the heart of the Shu state, which historians know relatively little about due to scant written records. Discoveries made at the site date back to the 12th and 11th centuries BC, and many of the items are now on display at an on-site museum. The site has revolutionized experts' understanding of how civilization developed in ancient China. In particular, evidence of a unique Shu culture suggests that the kingdom developed independently of neighboring societies in the Yellow River Valley, which was traditionally considered to be the cradle of Chinese civilization. The deputy director of the National Cultural Heritage Administration, Song Xinchao, told state-run press agency Xinhua that the latest finds ""enrich and deepen our understanding of the Sanxingdui culture."" The discovery of silk fibers and the remains of textiles may also expand our understanding of the Shu. Head of the excavation team and chief of the Sichuan Provincial Cultural Relics and Archaeology Research Institute, Tang Fei, said in a press conference that the discovery indicates that the kingdom ""was one of the important origins of silk in ancient China,"" according to Xinhua. Though not yet recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Sanxingdui is on the organization's ""tentative list"" for possible future inclusion. Along with other Shu archaeological sites, it is credited by the UN agency as ""an outstanding representative of the Bronze Age Civilization of China, East Asia and even the world.""

"Elon Musk responds to spying concerns in China: Trust us, we're just like TikTok",22/3/2021,"""There's a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential with any information,"" the billionaire said Saturday at the China Development Forum, an annual conference organized by a unit of the government's State Council. ""If Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, we will get shut down.""
Just hours before he spoke, Reuters and Bloomberg reported that China's military had banned Tesla vehicles from entering its complexes, expressing concerns over cameras equipped onboard. 
Additionally, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the government was restricting ""military staff and employees of key state-owned companies"" from driving the US automaker's cars, ""citing concerns that data the cars gather could be a source of national security leaks.""
The outlets cited anonymous sources. Tesla did not immediately respond Monday to requests for comment from CNN Business.
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in response to questions from CNN Business that it was not aware of the specifics of the Tesla case.
""But any enterprise operating and investing overseas must comply with the laws and regulations of the host country. As long as foreign enterprises come to China to operate and invest in accordance with the law and regulations, China takes a welcoming and open attitude and is dedicated to creating a better business environment for enterprises of all countries,"" the ministry said.
Speaking via video call on Saturday, Musk compared the controversy to the one that troubled TikTok last year, a company he said didn't receive ""trust."" The ByteDance-owned app faced a potential ban in the United States last year on alleged national security grounds.
""The United States wanted to shut down TikTok. Luckily, it did not happen,"" Musk said. ""Many people were concerned about TikTok. But I think this kind of concern is unnecessary, and we should learn lessons from it.""
High stakes
Tesla has made a big splash in China in recent years, particularly after it built its Shanghai Gigafactory.

","Tesla CEO Elon Musk says his company's cars would never be used for spying in China, in response to reports that the country's military has banned the vehicles over such concerns. ""There's a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential with any information,"" the billionaire said Saturday at the China Development Forum, an annual conference organized by a unit of the government's State Council. ""If Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, we will get shut down."" Just hours before he spoke, Reuters and Bloomberg reported that China's military had banned Tesla vehicles from entering its complexes, expressing concerns over cameras equipped onboard.  Additionally, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the government was restricting ""military staff and employees of key state-owned companies"" from driving the US automaker's cars, ""citing concerns that data the cars gather could be a source of national security leaks."" The outlets cited anonymous sources. Tesla did not immediately respond Monday to requests for comment from CNN Business. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in response to questions from CNN Business that it was not aware of the specifics of the Tesla case. ""But any enterprise operating and investing overseas must comply with the laws and regulations of the host country. As long as foreign enterprises come to China to operate and invest in accordance with the law and regulations, China takes a welcoming and open attitude and is dedicated to creating a better business environment for enterprises of all countries,"" the ministry said. Speaking via video call on Saturday, Musk compared the controversy to the one that troubled TikTok last year, a company he said didn't receive ""trust."" The ByteDance-owned app faced a potential ban in the United States last year on alleged national security grounds. ""The United States wanted to shut down TikTok. Luckily, it did not happen,"" Musk said. ""Many people were concerned about TikTok. But I think this kind of concern is unnecessary, and we should learn lessons from it."" High stakes Tesla has made a big splash in China in recent years, particularly after it built its Shanghai Gigafactory.

Atlanta spa attacks shine a light on anti-Asian hate crimes around the world,22/3/2021,"And it's not just an American problem. From the UK to Australia, reports of anti-East and anti-Southeast Asian hate crimes have increased in Western countries as the pandemic took hold this past year. At least 11 people of East and Southeast Asian descent CNN spoke to described racist and xenophobic incidents, such as people moving away from them on the train, verbal abuse and even physical assault. 
The past year has seen some Western politicians repeatedly stress China's connection to the Covid-19 outbreak, as well as raise the rhetoric against the Asian superpower. Within this environment, advocates say people of East Asian and Southeast Asian heritage have increasingly become a target for racism.

But many European countries, including France, Germany and Belgium, do not collect demographic data on ethnicity for historical reasons, making it difficult to take an accurate measure of the scale of the problem. 
Hate crime statistics are recorded in the UK. Figures from the London Metropolitan Police show more than 200 incidents of hate crime against people of East Asian appearance happened between June and September 2020 -- a 96% increase compared to the same period a year ago.
Peng Wang, a lecturer at Southampton University in southern England, says he was physically assaulted by a group of four men while jogging near his home one cold afternoon. 
The men yelled racial slurs at the 37-year-old, including ""Chinese virus,"" he told CNN. They got out of the car after Wang yelled back at them, punching him in the face and kicking him to the ground. He suffered minor facial injuries and a nose bleed, but the trauma of the event made him worry about leaving his home, his future in the UK and the safety of his young son, he told CNN.
 
""What they did was not civil, it should not happen in today's society. They just treated me like an animal,"" he said. Police have since arrested two men on suspicion of racially aggravated assault, according to two statements sent to CNN.
""When Donald Trump was the [US] President, and he said the 'China virus' -- that was absolutely wrong,"" Wang added. 
Polling done in June found that three-quarters of people of Chinese ethnicity in the UK had experienced being called a racial slur.
During an October debate on racism against the Chinese and East Asian community in Parliament, Scottish National Party lawmaker David Linden said some of his constituents ""described the attacks against them, with restaurants and take-outs being vandalized and boycotted and victims being punched, spat at and coughed on in the street and even verbally abused and blamed for the coronavirus pandemic.""
On the fringes 
As the pandemic made its way across Europe, activists in Spain and France began to notice a problem. Campaigns, such as #NoSoyUnVirus (#IAmNotAVirus), were created to raise awareness of the uptick in violence against Asians.
In March 2020, an American man of Chinese descent, Thomas Siu, said he was violently assaulted in Spain's capital, Madrid, after two men yelled racial slurs about the coronavirus at him. 
Siu, who was a student at the time, said that between January and March last year he was verbally assaulted 10 times. This time, he was not going to take it anymore, and instead yelled back at his verbal abusers.  
But the men did not stop. They walked over and beat him unconscious, the 30-year-old told CNN, adding that he was hospitalized for a week. ""I've always known that there is racism here and that people don't really acknowledge it,"" Siu told CNN.  

Susana Ye, a 29-year-old Spanish journalist who made a documentary about the country's Chinese diaspora in 2015, told CNN that violence against Asians in Spain has become normalized, and under-reported by the Spanish press. 
""For many it is not an important issue because many journalists do not live [in] or know members of the community,"" she said. ""They don't have an anti-racist perspective and they don't know about communities beyond their own."" 
She says there is a problem of under reporting of hate crimes in Spain due to language barriers, fears among some of being deported, and a tendency for the older generation to keep silent about incidents. 
""I think that people pick violence, verbal violence and physical violence because they don't expect us to react at all,"" she said. ""They are used to us keeping a low profile."" 

Spanish comic book author Quan Zhou Wu, who lives in Madrid, agrees. ""The attack in Atlanta hasn't been on the front pages of media in Spain, it is super, super minor news, we are invisible,"" she told CNN.
A 2019 report by the Spanish government shows that 2.9% of Asian nationals living in the country were victims of hate crimes. But while such offenses against Spanish nationals are recorded, the figures are not broken down by ethnicity. The government has yet to release 2020 figures.  
In France, campaigners say the pandemic has made racism even worse for its Asian community. ""Since last year the racism has become more overt. It's people saying they don't like Asians, or they don't like China,"" said Sun-Lay Tan, a spokesperson for Security for All, an organization that represents more than 40 Asian associations in France. 
'Make it better for future generations'
The campaign group estimates that in 2019, there was one hate crime incident against an Asian every two days in the Paris area alone. While they do not have data for 2020, Tan spoke of a number of anecdotes, including an account of someone having their shoulder dislocated the night after French President Emmanuel Macron announced a new lockdown in October. 
He said his first experience of xenophobia in France was last February, when a man switched places on the subway train after Tan sat down.  
""Our parents dealt with racism but they accepted it because they wanted to integrate into the country,"" he told CNN. ""We are the second generation of immigrants in France, our responsibility is to speak out"" and make France ""better for the next generation,"" he said.  
Berlin-based filmmaker Popo Fan, born in China's Jiangsu Province, said things were bad at the start of the pandemic, when he found himself too afraid to go outside or use public transportation. 

""In the beginning of the pandemic I was spat on, I was sworn at on the metro line in Berlin,"" Fan said. ""But I have a complicated feeling about it because the person that attacked me was a migrant himself. He was drunk and probably from a lower socio-economic background ... I feel like German society hasn't given him enough resources or education about racial diversity and public health. He doesn't have access to that information.""
He says blame lies with the German authorities, who ""don't seem to care enough about racial issues."" 
He said he was repeatedly targeted on the streets even before the outbreak. ""I had one person screaming at me ""go back to China."" The police told me that they couldn't do anything,"" Fan said. 
This is not only a European problem. A March report by Australian think tank, the Lowy Institute, found that more than one third of Chinese-Australians feel they have been treated differently or less favorably due to their heritage in the past year. And 18% say they have been physically threatened or attacked due to their Chinese heritage. 
Being conflated
Back in the UK, Singaporean student Kay Leong told CNN that a person selling roses on the street started shouting ""coronavirus, coronavirus"" at her after she refused to buy flowers. 
'I'm not from China but I'd imagine all Asians get conflated when it comes to this kind of racism,"" she told CNN. ""I've also noticed more leering. But I will say, this kind of racism or intimidation isn't new to me, I've faced it since I came to London in 2016 for my undergrad [studies]."" 
Kate Ng, a 28-year-old Malaysian-Chinese journalist at British newspaper The Independent, told CNN that while the attacks in the US appear to be a lot more pervasive, the incidents reported in the UK have spread a chill among Southeast Asians. 
""I want to go out by myself when there are more people around. But I ask myself: 'Is it more likely I will be verbally abused or attacked?' That fear is very palpable,"" she said. 
This story has been updated to correct the year Susana Ye's documentary released.
","The outpouring of grief and anger over the news that six Asian women were among those killed in the shootings at three Atlanta area massage parlors has drawn attention to the rise of anti-Asian violence in the US.

"5 things to know for March 22: Covid, immigration, spa killings, Afghanistan, China",22/3/2021,"Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. 
(You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)
1. Coronavirus
Experts are split on whether the US is on the brink of another coronavirus surge. One very concerning sign? Throngs of spring breakers flocking to hot spots like Miami Beach, where officials enacted emergency curfews to keep people off the streets. Things got ugly this weekend when officers fired pepper balls into crowds and arrested dozens. In Brazil, hospitals are near collapse and the country reported spiking case numbers over the last week. No Brazilian states have ICU occupancy rates below 70%, and only two have occupancy below 80%. Thankfully, the first batch of coronavirus vaccines sent through the COVAX program arrived in Brazil yesterday. India is also seeing ominous numbers. Infections there have been increasing for almost a week, and the latest numbers mark the biggest case rise since November.

2. Immigration
The Biden administration is trying to get a grip on the surge of young migrants at the southern border, and Republican opponents are seeing it as a chance to sow division and doubt about the President's immigration strategies. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas insists the border is closed to migrants right now, but there's an exception for unaccompanied minors. As of Saturday, more than 5,000 of these children were in custody at the border. President Biden says he plans to rebuild a system that lets potential child migrants seek asylum in their home countries so they don't make the perilous journey through human trafficking networks to the southern border. Some critics say Biden reversed Trump-era policies that were considered inhumane before the new administration was ready to deal with the influx it would cause.

3. Spa killings
Hundreds gathered in Georgia, Denver, New York City and other places across the US over the weekend to honor the eight lives lost in last week's Atlanta-area spa shootings and to call for an end to hate targeting Asian communities. Though the suspect told police he had a sex addiction (which isn't a medically recognized diagnosis), many leaders and activists believe it was a hate crime. Six of the eight victims were Asian women. The attack has also raised awareness of anti-Asian hate across the world. Statistics out of London showed a 96% increase in anti-Asian hate crimes in 2020 over the prior year.

4. Afghanistan
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an unannounced stop in Afghanistan this weekend to meet with President Ashraf Ghani and other officials. The defense secretary's visit comes as the US is deciding whether it will adhere to an agreement the Trump administration reached last year with the Taliban to remove all US forces from the country by May 1. The Biden administration is considering a six-month extension for American troops there as that deadline nears. Austin says he isn't aware of any final decision by Biden or what the timeline may be. This was Austin's first visit to the country as the top US defense official.

5. China
Detained Canadian Michael Kovrig is on trial in Beijing on espionage charges, and his case has frayed relations among Canada, China and the US. Kovrig is one of two Canadians detained since 2018, following the arrest in Vancouver of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat, is accused by Chinese authorities of stealing sensitive information and intelligence. Another Canadian, Michael Spavor, faced trial in China last week on related charges. Both Washington and Ottawa have repeatedly called for Kovrig and Spavor's release. Diplomats from more than two dozen countries were denied access to the Chinese court where Kovrig's trial is being held. Meanwhile, US and Chinese officials' diplomatic summit in Alaska this weekend did not go well. The sides traded barbs and insults during the opening meeting, signaling an inauspicious start to a new era of relations.

Philippines demands Chinese fishing flotilla leave disputed South China Sea reef,22/3/2021,"Philippine government officials on Saturday released pictures of what they said were 220 Chinese vessels moored at the boomerang-shaped Whitsun Reef, which Manila calls the Julian Felipe Reef, close to the western Philippine province of Palawan in the South China Sea on March 7. 
""We call on the Chinese to stop this incursion and immediately recall these boats violating our maritime rights and encroaching into our sovereign territory,"" Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said Sunday, according to state-run Philippine News Agency (PNA).
The reef, which is part of the Spratly Islands archipelago, is claimed by both governments. The Philippines maintains that it falls inside the country's exclusive economic zone.  A 2016 ruling by a United Nations tribunal dismissed China's claim to virtually all of the South China Sea, though Beijing has refused to recognize the decision.

Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Teodoro Locsin Jr. said he had lodged a protest with the Chinese government over the presence of the Chinese vessels, tweeting late Sunday, ""Diplomatic protest fired off tonight; can't wait for first light.""
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Monday the fishing boats were engaged in routine operations in what China calls the Nansha Islands.
""For a long period of time, Chinese fishing boats have been fishing in adjacent waters. Some ships have been sheltering from the wind. It is very normal. We hope relevant sides could look at this rationally,"" spokesperson Hua Chunying said.
The National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea released pictures of the vessels over the weekend, CNN Philippines reported, citing cause for concern ""due to the possible overfishing and destruction of the marine environment."" However, the task force also noted the vessels were not fishing when sighted despite the weather being clear.
Lorenzana called developments a ""clear provocative action of militarizing the area"" in a statement reported by the PNA.

China has been accused of using its vast fishing fleets to help assert Beijing's territorial claims throughout the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea, though China has dismissed the accusations as groundless.
In a 2019 report on the fleet, the Center for Strategic and International Studies said ""a significant number of fishing vessels in the area forgo fishing full-time to serve as a direct arm of the state,"" and that fishing boats ""stand at least as much chance of triggering a violent clash as do the region's armed forces.""
While the Whitsun Reef still remains outside of Beijing's direct control, China has unilaterally transformed other reefs in the Spratly chain into man-made islands with substantial infrastructure and military fortifications, including missiles, runways and weapons systems.
And the Chinese fishing fleet has been seen pressuring other Philippine claims in the Spratlys.
For example, from early 2019 through March 2020 China maintained a presence of maritime militia vessels around Thitu Island, the largest Philippine occupied island in the Spratly archipelago, according to the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative. 
Chinese warships head into Sea of Japan
As Chinese ships were drawing attention in the South China Sea, the People's Liberation Army Navy was showing some of its recently acquired muscle in the waters of the Sea of Japan.
The Japanese Defense Ministry and Chinese state-run outlet Global Times reported that a PLA Navy Type 055 guided-missile destroyer, the Nanchang, led a force of a Type 052 destroyer and Type 054 frigate through the Tsushima Strait and into the Sea of Japan for the first time.
""Entering the Sea of Japan shows that the Type 055 has gained the capability to patrol in distant sea regions, and is an indication of the PLA Navy's progress,"" Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert, told Global Times.
Japan's Defense Ministry said reconnaissance craft confirmed the Chinese ships went through the Tsushima Strait, saying it was the first time for Japan's forces to spot the Type 055 destroyer.
The Type 055 is seen as a key component of China's rapidly modernizing fleet as the PLA Navy pushes to project its influence farther from the country's shores.
""This ship in particular has a sophisticated design, stealth features, radars, and a large missile inventory. It is larger and more powerful than most US, Japanese, and South Korean destroyers,"" Rand Corp. senior analyst Timothy Heath said in 2018.
The deployment of the Chinese ships into the Sea of Japan came just days after US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with their counterparts in Tokyo for a series of bilateral talks.
After those talks, Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Toshimitsu Motegi said the US and Japan ""oppose any attempts to alter the status quo in the area including East China Sea and South China Sea.""
Motegi also said the US had reconfirmed its commitment to help Japan defend the Senkakus, a string of disputed islands in the East China Sea that China calls the Diayous and claims as its own.
But in the Global Times report, Song, the military expert, said the deployment of the Chinese warships to the Sea of Japan was likely long-planned and routine.
""The PLA's training is not targeted at Japan or the US, but these countries will likely perceive it that way because they see China as their imaginary enemy,"" Song said in the report.
""The PLA needs to boost its combat capability in distant seas to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests in an uncertain and unstable world, with external threats from a small circle led by the US,"" Song told Global Times.
","The Philippines has demanded that China recall more than 200 Chinese boats it said had been spotted at a disputed reef claimed by both Manila and Beijing, describing their presence as a ""clear provocative action."" Philippine government officials on Saturday released pictures of what they said were 220 Chinese vessels moored at the boomerang-shaped Whitsun Reef, which Manila calls the Julian Felipe Reef, close to the western Philippine province of Palawan in the South China Sea on March 7.  ""We call on the Chinese to stop this incursion and immediately recall these boats violating our maritime rights and encroaching into our sovereign territory,"" Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said Sunday, according to state-run Philippine News Agency (PNA). The reef, which is part of the Spratly Islands archipelago, is claimed by both governments. The Philippines maintains that it falls inside the country's exclusive economic zone.  A 2016 ruling by a United Nations tribunal dismissed China's claim to virtually all of the South China Sea, though Beijing has refused to recognize the decision. Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Teodoro Locsin Jr. said he had lodged a protest with the Chinese government over the presence of the Chinese vessels, tweeting late Sunday, ""Diplomatic protest fired off tonight; can't wait for first light."" A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Monday the fishing boats were engaged in routine operations in what China calls the Nansha Islands. ""For a long period of time, Chinese fishing boats have been fishing in adjacent waters. Some ships have been sheltering from the wind. It is very normal. We hope relevant sides could look at this rationally,"" spokesperson Hua Chunying said. The National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea released pictures of the vessels over the weekend, CNN Philippines reported, citing cause for concern ""due to the possible overfishing and destruction of the marine environment."" However, the task force also noted the vessels were not fishing when sighted despite the weather being clear.

Biden vows to ease border surge as Republicans sense a political opening,22/3/2021,"After weeks of refusing to call the crossings that have overwhelmed border posts a ""crisis,"" the administration is making an aggressive attempt to defuse the situation and the toxic politics it has stirred in Washington.
The President said Sunday that the administration planned to rebuild a system that allows potential child migrants to seek asylum in their home countries to prevent them making the perilous journey through human trafficking networks to the US border with Mexico. 
""I know what's going on in those facilities,"" Biden said after returning to the White House from Camp David, pledging to travel to the border himself ""at some point.""
In a new sign of political urgency from the administration, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas did quadruple duty on four Sunday political TV shows, pushing back against criticism that the administration was caught off guard by the migrant surge and actively contributed to it with a swift rewriting of immigration rules when it took office.
""We are working round the clock 24/7,"" Mayorkas told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union."" ""We have dealt with surges in the past and the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security will succeed.""
Mayorkas dismissed accusations that the Biden administration reversed some of ex-President Donald Trump's policies it considered inhumane before it was ready to handle an influx. He could not give a precise timeline for when thousands of children could be moved from cramped border patrol stations to more suitable accommodation that is especially crucial amid the pandemic. Mayorkas also would not guarantee immediate press access to the inside of migrant border posts, citing restrictions due to Covid-19. The failure to do so has called into question the new White House's vows for more transparency and Biden's own pledge to always level with Americans and to tell them the truth about the extent of national crises.
The Homeland Security secretary also sought to counter false claims by Biden's Republican critics that the new White House has simply thrown open the border to everyone.
""We are elevating our messaging, so that the individuals do know that they cannot come to the border. The border is closed,"" Mayorkas told Bash.
A humanitarian and political problem 
At the heart of the current crisis at the border is a humanitarian dilemma about what to do with single children and teenagers seeking to enter the country. As part of a slew of changes to immigration policy, the Biden administration reversed a Trump-era strategy of returning all single migrant children at the border, a practice that left them vulnerable to desperate conditions in grim camps or traffickers in Mexico. The children, many of whom have relatives in the US already, are now allowed into the United States pending asylum applications. Contrary to claims by Republicans, the border is not open to everyone. Most undocumented families and individuals who try to cross get turned back. 
Apart from the human context of the crisis ！ with thousands of desperate people fleeing violence, repression and the impact of natural disasters in Central America -- the situation is turning into a thorny political problem. It is distracting from Biden's hopes of selling his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue plan to the public and competing for attention as officials plead with Americans to stick to social distancing to avoid a new spike in the pandemic before the vaccine drive can fully suppress infections. The issue is certain to occupy a large portion of Biden's long-awaited first formal press conference on Thursday, which he had hoped to use to highlight his response to the pandemic, including busting through his pledge to administer 100 million vaccine doses in his first 100 days more than a month early.
The controversy over the border is building on its own momentum and threatens to erode the already thin political space in which bipartisan immigration reform might take place in the Senate. Any crisis in which an administration appears outpaced by events is dangerous for a new White House. And the fate of the children is offering an immediate reminder that even in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic and consequent economic slump, a president can face multiple crises simultaneously. In recent days alone, Biden has juggled fears of a new wave of Covid-19, the immigration situation and waged a two-front diplomatic showdown with Russia and China.
Republicans sense that the child migrant crisis is an opening to damage Biden -- and Trump harnessed that Sunday by issuing a statement that included several misleading statements and accused the President of turning a ""national triumph into a national disaster"" at the border. Trump, whose White House pursued immigration policies that included the cruel separation of migrant families and children -- many of whom still can't be traced -- built his White House run in 2016 on a scorched earth immigration strategy. The issue remains powerful among GOP base voters and offers the former President a chance to reinject himself into political debate on an issue where Biden is vulnerable.
Controversy builds in Washington 
The White House knew the number of migrants arriving at the border would swell once Biden took office. But they did not expect a surge of this size, according to CNN reporting published Saturday night based on conversations with more than a dozen administration officials. 
The rising numbers have overwhelmed processing points and forced the administration to call in the Federal Emergency Management Agency to set up facilities to care for kids. More than 15,000 unaccompanied migrant minors are now in US custody, according to officials.
Republicans have seized on the border crisis with trips down to frontier states and by claiming that Biden's policies have caused open season for undocumented migrants. This is a perfect issue for the GOP as it allows the party to try to undermine the new Democratic President and draw attention away from his popular management of the pandemic. Immigration is a glue that fixes the GOP's splits, and allows pro- and anti-Trump factions to unite behind a single message. And with midterm elections ahead next year, illegal immigration is the best possible rallying call for the Republican base.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, recently returned from demagoguing the issue at the border, playing into racial prejudices by suggesting Yemenis, Sri Lankans and Chinese people were coming into the US.
Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, a potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate, lashed out at what members of his party uniformly call a ""Biden border crisis."" 
""The border right now is wide open because the Biden administration dismantled the very effective policies of the Trump administration and the agreements we had with Mexico and other Latin American countries,"" Cotton said on ""Fox News Sunday.""
Cotton misrepresented the true state of affairs at the border. But the power of the immigration debate lies in the suggestion of untamed immigration, with critics pointing to ""outsiders"" who they say have no right to be in America -- even though the law stipulates that people fleeing violence or other danger have a right to seek asylum. 
Republican Sen. Rob Portman, who does not have to fear a primary challenge from anti-immigration pro-Trump forces since he is retiring, is in a group of senators whom the White House might look to for bipartisan cooperation.
But the Ohio senator said people are not heeding Biden's warnings against people coming to the border.
""I spoke to single individuals who are coming over at night, men who told me that they'd heard what President Biden said and they were coming anyway,"" Portman said on CBS ""Face the Nation"" after touring facilities last week in Texas.
""I talked to children and talked to them about the messaging. And what they're hearing is that you can now come into the United States, which you can, as a kid. And so they're going to keep coming.""
Vulnerability for the President 
The White House responds to such criticism by accusing the Trump administration -- which made harsh anti-immigration laws an article of faith -- of leaving the system in disrepair. While the argument might be partially justified, no new administration can continually blame its predecessor once it has power and expect to avoid collateral political damage. 
A recent CNN/SSRS poll underscored how immigration is an issue on which Biden is most vulnerable.
While Biden's approval rating stood at 51% amid satisfaction with his handling of the pandemic since taking office, only 43% of Americans approved of his performance on the immigration issued and 49% disapproved. The poll was conducted more than two weeks ago, before the full extent of events on the border became clear.
Biden's hopes of solving this early challenge will now rest on the capacity of officials like Mayorkas to open sufficient facilities to move unaccompanied children from jammed border posts into Health and Human Services Department facilities and to stop immigrant flows even though smugglers and children know they can get a foothold in the US.
Aid to Central American states could make a difference in easing the conditions that cause migrants to flee. But such long-term solutions are unlikely to change the dynamic in the short term -- or slake what officials say is pent-up demand among immigrants that built during the Trump years.
The situation will also force the White House to balance its own desire to end the often cruel Trump administration policies while shielding the President from political vulnerability on the issue.
""We will not abandon our values and our principles. We will not abandon the needs of vulnerable children. That is what this is all about,"" Mayorkas said on ""State of the Union."" 
""We are executing on our plan. It does take time. It is difficult.""

Diplomats denied access as Canadian Michael Kovrig goes on trial in China,22/3/2021,"Kovrig is one of two Canadians detained since 2018, following the arrest in Vancouver of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, who is currently fighting extradition to the United States, where she is wanted for allegedly breaching sanctions against Iran. On Friday, Canadian Michael Spavor went on trial in Dandong, in northeastern China. His trial was held behind closed doors and only lasted two hours. 
Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat who worked for the International Crisis Group (ICG), is accused by the Chinese authorities of ""stealing sensitive information and intelligence through contacts in China since 2017,"" while Spavor, a businessman with a focus on North Korea, is accused of providing intelligence to Kovrig.
Spavor's trial took place as US and Chinese officials were trading barbs at the opening of a diplomatic summit in Alaska, the first time the countries' top diplomats have met since US President Joe Biden took office. 
Both Washington and Ottawa have repeatedly called for Kovrig and Spavor's release, denouncing their detention as political and arbitrary. 
Speaking to reporters outside court Monday, Canada's charge d'affairs Jim Nickel accused China of breaching international treaty obligations by denying consular officials access to their citizens. 
""Michael Kovrig has been detained for two years now, he's been arbitrarily detained, and now we see the court process itself is not transparent, and we're very troubled by this,"" he said, adding that access had been denied because ""this is a so-called national security case."" 
Nickel thanked other diplomats for showing solidarity with Canada. He said there were some 28 representatives from 26 different countries outside the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate Court on Monday, ""lending their voice for the immediate release of Michael Kovrig.""
Reuters listed the US, United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Netherlands and Czech Republic as among the countries with diplomatic representation outside the court. 
Those diplomats and journalists were met by a large police presence. Repeated attempts by the diplomats to enter the building before the trial got underway were rebuffed, according to reporters at the scene. 

Following Spavor's speedy trial Friday, the court in Dandong said in a statement that it would ""deliver its verdict at a later date in accordance with the law.""
Family members and contacts of the two Canadian men have described them being held in poor conditions, and denied outside contact. Almost all in-person consular visits to foreign prisoners in China have been paused since last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, with diplomats only able to speak to those detained via the phone.
After Kovrig and Spavor were charged with espionage last year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau denounced the ""political"" nature of their case, saying their detention was a ""decision made by the Chinese government and we deplore it.""
Chinese courts have a conviction rate of more than 99% and observers say the release of the two men could now rest on a diplomatic solution, potentially after a face-saving conviction and sentence of time served. 
Trudeau has repeatedly refused to consider any trade of the two Canadians for Meng, whose detention has seen relations plunge between Ottawa and Beijing. Last month, Canada's parliament approved a non-binding motion accusing China of committing genocide against its Muslim minorities in the western region of Xinjiang, further straining ties between the two countries.

Connie Chung: The media is miserably late covering anti-Asian violence,21/3/2021,"""We have been miserably late,"" journalist Connie Chung told CNN's Chief Media Correspondent Brian Stelter on ""Reliable Sources"" Sunday. ""We are insignificant, and it's so apparent to all of us who are Asian."" 
Chung said ""anti-Asian hate started the moment it came out of President Trump's mouth,"" adding that it started picking up the moment Trump called Covid-19 The China Virus or the Kung Flu.
Anti-Asian hate crimes have more than doubled during the pandemic, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.
Last week, eight people were shot in Atlanta, and six of them were Asian. Since then, stories about anti-Asian violence have filled the news. President Joe Biden condemned the shooting and said hate crimes against Asian Americans have been ""skyrocketing"" since the coronavirus pandemic began. The shooting happened several days ago.
The suspect, 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long, claimed responsibility for the shootings, according to the sheriff's office in Cherokee County, where he faces four counts of murder with malice, one count of attempted murder, one count of aggravated assault and five counts of using a firearm while committing a felony. He also has been charged with four counts of murder in Atlanta, police there said. 
But local law enforcement has yet to call it a hate crime.
In response to the shootings, the Asian American Journalists Association released a list of journalistic guidelines. 
""Newsrooms were rushing to describe this shooting as not racially motivated,"" the organization's president and Washington Post reporter Michelle Ye Hee Lee said. ""For the first time to 10 years, our website crashed because of the traffic.""
Newsrooms across the country are relying on Asian-American journalists to tell the stories of anti-Asian hate as they unfold. And some of those journalists are using Twitter to express their concerns, fear, and need for solidarity.

""We are very much invisible in the newsroom and underrepresented especially in leadership,"" Lee said.
In an effort to support Asian-American journalists, journalist Sonia Weiser partnered with AAJA and launched a therapy relief fund on GoFundMe. 
""The journalism industry is calling on the most vulnerable to share their stories and provide on-the-ground reporting offering little financial compensation or emotional support in exchange for labor,"" the page's description reads. The fund was created to secure Asian American and Pacific Islander journalists with funding for mental wellness resources needed to process trauma.
","Media outlets are ramping up their coverage of anti-Asian violence following last week's Atlanta shootings, but many Asian-American journalists feel the issue has been ignored for far too long. ""We have been miserably late,"" journalist Connie Chung told CNN's Chief Media Correspondent Brian Stelter on ""Reliable Sources"" Sunday. ""We are insignificant, and it's so apparent to all of us who are Asian.""  Chung said ""anti-Asian hate started the moment it came out of President Trump's mouth,"" adding that it started picking up the moment Trump called Covid-19 The China Virus or the Kung Flu. Anti-Asian hate crimes have more than doubled during the pandemic, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Last week, eight people were shot in Atlanta, and six of them were Asian. Since then, stories about anti-Asian violence have filled the news. President Joe Biden condemned the shooting and said hate crimes against Asian Americans have been ""skyrocketing"" since the coronavirus pandemic began. The shooting happened several days ago. The suspect, 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long, claimed responsibility for the shootings, according to the sheriff's office in Cherokee County, where he faces four counts of murder with malice, one count of attempted murder, one count of aggravated assault and five counts of using a firearm while committing a felony. He also has been charged with four counts of murder in Atlanta, police there said.  But local law enforcement has yet to call it a hate crime. In response to the shootings, the Asian American Journalists Association released a list of journalistic guidelines.  ""Newsrooms were rushing to describe this shooting as not racially motivated,"" the organization's president and Washington Post reporter Michelle Ye Hee Lee said. ""For the first time to 10 years, our website crashed because of the traffic.""

My parents came to the US from Korea for a better future. We must stop the hate,21/3/2021," 
The attacks and murders of Asians and Asian-Americans, most recently six Asian women among the eight shot dead in my hometown of Atlanta, prove that even if we follow the rules, we keep our mouths shut, and we keep our heads down, we still get murdered. Even if the country says it loves our culture and our food, we are still seen as foreigners who don't belong here. We are considered White-adjacent, until we aren't. In the same vein, we are invisible and our place in history seems to be missing.  
 
But by believing that we can maybe one day become ""White,"" we are perpetuating White supremacy. The topic of race in America, which is primarily focused on White vs. Black, often leaves Asian Americans invisible and silenced. And even after horrific events like this, people still choose to believe that racism against the AAPI community isn't real. Why? Because the topic of race in America is so focused on White vs. Black that racism against any other community can't be real or serious enough? This is not to take away from the severity of what has been happening to our Black brothers and sisters for centuries, but somehow racism and hatred towards Asians has been less visible even though it is very real and very alive.
 
For most of us, January 26, 2020 was the day Kobe Bryant died in a horrific helicopter crash. I'll forever remember his death, too. He was, after all, one of my favorite athletes. However, another event was also casting its creeping shadow. 
 
It wasn't given the name Covid-19 then, but a deadly coronavirus that was new to the public consciousness was making its way through global headlines. Not much was known about the virus, other than that the first cases were reported in Wuhan, China, and the virus was extremely contagious. My then-boyfriend-and-now-fianc└ and I decided to dine out for a late lunch at a restaurant in Smyrna, Georgia. When we arrived, nothing seemed to be off.  We didn't get any stares or dirty looks. No one avoided standing too close to us or made any nasty comments. 
 
As a matter of fact, I wasn't even thinking about being treated differently for being Asian. But we were the only people to be seated outside on the covered patio when the dining room had more than enough seats for us. It was a chilly January day so I asked if we could be moved to the dining room and the hostess obliged.  
 
After being seated inside, our server was very short with us and barely made an attempt to stop by the table to check on us after taking our order -- she did the bare minimum. It wasn't until she apparently realized that we were the ""American"" type of Asians who spoke English without accents that she decided to provide a semblance of customer service. And I couldn't help but wonder if we were possibly being racially profiled in connection to Covid-19.
 
It's been a rough year, to say the least. And in more ways than one. Between having a President who spewed harshly racist rhetoric, a global pandemic and a racial reckoning following the killing of George Floyd, everyone has had their fair share of trauma. 
 
I am not the spokesperson for millennials or children of immigrants, but I can confidently say it's hard for my generation to have to witness events like the shootings in Atlanta and the attacks on elderly Asians in places like New York and San Francisco. They are our grandparents, aunts, uncles, parents. Immigrants who came to America for a new beginning, working their way through odd jobs and long hours to provide for their families and often making little to no money, in pursuit of the American Dream. Innocents minding their own business, walking down the street, at their jobs, eating at restaurants, and yet, being attacked for being Asian. It's unfathomable. But we see how undeserved and wrong this is.  How undeserving any minority community is of racial attacks. 
 
So, we fight back by calling it what it is. We take to the streets, to social media, to our private text messages and conversations and we bring awareness. We let the world know this is NOT OK.  
 
It's also painful to hear someone like Captain Jay Baker, a public information officer at the Cherokee County, Georgia, Sheriff's Office, seem to make excuses for the alleged Atlanta shooter with comments like, ""he was pretty much fed up"" and Tuesday ""was a really bad day for him."" Baker has since been removed as spokesman and Sheriff Frank Reynolds said that Baker's comments were not intended to disrespect any of the victims as ""empathy or sympathy for the suspect,"" but they still completely take away from the fact that innocent Asian people were killed. Or that authorities did not immediately label it a hate crime after the suspect told the police that he had a ""sexual addiction"" and had carried out the shootings at the massage parlors to eliminate his ""temptation."" 
 
You can't tell me that this is not the epitome of White privilege, or that White privilege does not exist. A man charged with senselessly killing AAPI women told authorities that his motives were not racially charged and at least some appear to take his words seriously. This sets a dangerous precedent for people who will act on their hatred toward a certain community. It's hard to have hope for the future and for humanity when our trauma and struggles are constantly being ignored and brushed under the rug. Or even worse, when it's believed we deserve this. 
 
But this time feels different. The reaction to what has happened in Atlanta is heartwarming and enough to keep us going. The outpouring of support coming from all different directions is a sign that we are bigger than this.  
 
We need leaders who will hold racists, criminals, murderers and assailants accountable for their actions and who will call it what it is. We need parents to teach their children to be good and decent human beings. We need allies and advocates who will continue to fight the good fight and support their colleagues, friends, neighbors, etc. We need to continue to have empathy and sympathy toward one another without comparing pain and suffering. 
 
If you really think about it, the Asian and Black communities are more interwoven than we initially think. It's important to acknowledge that our struggles are wildly different, and while it is unproductive to compare them to one another, our experiences and struggles are inexplicably linked.  
 
These incidents are not accidental or isolated. They are intentional, and my community is being targeted. We are all being targeted. We are in danger. We are scared and angry. And we just want a fair chance at living. For everyone grieving or worried about their loved ones coming home safely, we must stop the hate. 
","My parents, like many immigrants, came to the United States from Korea for a better future. They were taught that this is the land of endless opportunities and that there were rules to follow in order to reach that better future. The rules were so strong, clear and always prevalent: to make sure they never took their eyes off the prize. These ""rules"" were supposed to keep the American ideal alive but in effect kept foreigners in their place and away from the majority. This is the ""model minority"" myth.  And as is increasingly obvious, a myth is exactly what it is.    The attacks and murders of Asians and Asian-Americans, most recently six Asian women among the eight shot dead in my hometown of Atlanta, prove that even if we follow the rules, we keep our mouths shut, and we keep our heads down, we still get murdered. Even if the country says it loves our culture and our food, we are still seen as foreigners who don't belong here. We are considered White-adjacent, until we aren't.

"To help Venezuelans, Biden can go beyond granting temporary immigration status",21/3/2021,"
By extending TPS to Venezuelan nationals who have been in the US since at least March 8, the Biden administration gave them temporary legal status to live and work without fear of deportation. Given the extraordinary humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, this status should have been granted years ago -- and it may have been, if not for the harsh immigration policies of the Trump administration. As former US Ambassador to Venezuela Charles Shapiro told me, TPS was ""long overdue.""  

According to the United Nations, 5.4 million Venezuelans have fled their country for political and economic reasons. Most have crossed borders to Colombia and Brazil, which are bearing the brunt of the mass exodus from Venezuela's collapse under dictator Nicol│s Maduro, but many have come to the US as well. 
Offering TPS to an estimated 300,000 eligible Venezuelans here is a significant humanitarian move by the US and also a significant delivery of a campaign promise Biden made. 
But we should not stop there. The political, economic and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, brought on by years of mismanagement and corruption under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Ch│vez, warrants a robust response from the US. TPS should be just the first step in our efforts to help the Venezuelan people.
First and foremost, the Biden administration should focus on promoting democracy and reestablishing the US as a democratic leader in the region. Before the Trump administration, promoting and defending democracy were pillars of US foreign policy in Latin America and around the world. The January 6 US Capitol riot made this work harder for our diplomats, as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has indicated, but getting back to our own democratic principles at home, including voting rights, will help us to regain a leadership role in promoting democratic principles and governance abroad. 
Venezuela stands as a stark example of what happens to countries when democratically-elected leaders do not govern democratically, when democratic institutions are destroyed and when elections are no longer free or fair. The Venezuelan opposition has spent years fighting for free and fair elections, while the Venezuelan people have been forced to cross borders for food and medicine and out of a fear of political persecution.
The corruption and graft of the Maduro regime, supported by the Venezuelan military and security services, have made it nearly impossible to achieve political change in the country.
The Biden administration should start anew with allies in Latin America and Europe to work toward finding a peaceful, democratic solution to the political and economic crisis in Venezuela. Working through the Lima Group and the Organization of American States, the United States should lead in the efforts to bring about free and fair elections in Venezuela and a peaceful transfer of power.
Biden should also be prepared to roll back general oil sanctions on Venezuela if it means bringing Maduro to the negotiating table to hammer out a deal to allow free and fair elections to be held. 
So far, those general sanctions have harmed the Venezuelan people, not just the country's leaders, and have failed to meet their objective of ousting Maduro. The US placed sanctions on the Venezuelan oil sector in January 2019, when opposition leader Juan Guaid┏ was ascendent and the Trump team believed Maduro would be overthrown quickly. But that did not happen. 
While Guaid┏ mounted a valiant, mostly peaceful campaign against Maduro and gained support from the international community as the legitimate interim leader of Venezuela, he has not yet been able to garner enough support from the military to force Maduro from power. Meanwhile, Maduro and his cronies have been able to keep the government afloat with support from Russia, China, and Iran and by evading US oil sanctions, attempting to sell its gold, and allegedly, drug trafficking in the region.
Yes, the crisis in Venezuela began long before US oil sanctions were put in place, but they have not helped the situation. Instead, sanctions on Venezuela should be targeted and specific, focused on individuals and entities close to and funding Maduro. This includes Venezuelans in the military, the security forces protecting Maduro, and state-owned enterprises that profit off of Maduro's corruption at the expense of the Venezuelan people. Venezuelans undermining democratic institutions, or who are associated with alleged human-rights abuses, should also face sanctions.
Defending human rights in Venezuela should be a top priority for the Biden administration as well. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the United Nations have all alleged abuses by the Maduro regime. Although the Venezuelan government has denied these reports, defending democracy means defending human rights and the US should do its part to hold Maduro to account.
Venezuela's crisis is not going to be resolved overnight. With 96% of Venezuelan households living in poverty today, it will take generations to reverse the degradation. 
The coronavirus pandemic, of course, has only worsened the crisis in the last year. The Biden administration should look for other ways to help the Venezuelan people get the humanitarian assistance they need, including vaccines. The good news is there is bipartisan support in the US to help the Venezuelan people. Hopefully, TPS is just the first step.
","The US government's decision to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to Venezuelans is a welcome move, and it took President Joe Biden winning the White House to make it a reality. Broad US economic sanctions on Venezuela and former President Donald Trump's expansion of them, even as his administration declined to grant immigration status to Venezuelans who had fled their country, made an already devastating situation in Venezuela worse.  By extending TPS to Venezuelan nationals who have been in the US since at least March 8, the Biden administration gave them temporary legal status to live and work without fear of deportation.

Who's teaching us to hate,21/3/2021,"A 21-year-old man was arrested and charged with shooting to death eight people, including six Asian women, in metropolitan Atlanta. While officials said they were investigating the motive -- they cited the suspect's claim he had a ""sex addiction"" -- there was growing outrage over the spate of attacks ever since the first cases of Covid-19 were reported in China, and politicians, including then-President Donald Trump, labeled it the ""China virus.""
""Politicians didn't invent prejudice, but they are exploiting it for political gain, and destroying lives in the process,"" wrote Frida Ghitis. ""During House hearings on anti-Asian violence Thursday, Texas GOP Rep. Chip Roy, somehow managed to speak approvingly of lynchings -- 'Find all the rope in Texas and get a tall oak tree...we take justice very seriously...' -- while excoriating China's regime and its role in the pandemic. It was a virtuoso performance of false equivalency and incitement. But stoking racism and fear of immigrants has become one of the go-to tools of the Trumpist Republican Party.""
Jennifer Ho, the daughter of a refugee father from China and an immigrant mother from Jamaica, lived in the South for nearly 20 years. She wrote that ""To be an Asian woman in America means you can't just be what you are: a fully enfranchised human being. It means you are a blank screen on which others project their stories, especially, too often, their sexualized fantasies -- because US culture has long presented Asian women as sexualized objects for White male enjoyment."" A professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Ho is the president of the Association for Asian American Studies. 
""To be an Asian woman working in the US South in the massage industry means being an object, not a subject...It means further disappearing: being one of six women killed in what people aren't even calling a racially motivated crime, although can there be any doubt that it was misogyny and toxic masculinity that killed you?"" 
CNN's Kristie Lu Stout wrote from Hong Kong that ""hate has turned my once proud and confident Asian-American mother into a shut-in. It's not because of the virus as Covid-19 continues to rage in my home state of California. It's because she is absolutely certain that as an older Asian woman with a limp she will be targeted by violence. THIS is the America she left her homeland for?"" 
Adeline Chen, a features producer in Atlanta for CNN International, took a road trip with her family through the South last summer because further travels seemed risky. ""While on the surface, it might have seemed like a safe and socially distant trip, it felt anything but during this period of racial reckoning and a pandemic,"" she wrote. ""My daughter and I were often the sole minorities in RV parks surrounded by flags and signs supporting then-President Donald Trump, who routinely called Covid-19 the 'China Virus' or 'Kung Flu.'... Many people can afford to excuse the 'crazy uncle' who says racist things, but in doing so, they allow unacceptable rhetoric that has real life harmful implications for those like myself, who cannot shed their skin -- nor would want to.""
In just the first two months of this year, ""Asian Americans have reported being targeted at least 500 times,"" John Avlon pointed out. ""In recent weeks, we've seen the murder of an 87-year-old Thai immigrant, Vichar Ratanapakdee, as well as the brutal assault of a 67-year-old man in San Francisco not named publicly, and the beating of 27-year-old Denny Kim in LA's Koreatown, who says his attackers shouted 'You have the Chinese Virus, go back to China.'""

War of words

It didn't take long. President Joe Biden isn't even finished with his first 100 days in office and he's already locked in a war of words with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
On Wednesday, Biden told interviewer George Stephanopoulos that he would indeed characterize Putin as a ""killer"" and said he would ""pay a price"" after a US government intelligence report accusing Russia of meddling in the 2020 election to help Donald Trump. Putin answered Biden, ""I wish you health."" As Russia expert Daniel Treisman wrote, ""It was an interesting choice of phrase for a leader accused of having his enemies poisoned...All this suggests the depths to which US-Russia relations have sunk."" 
Biden's policy on Russia couldn't be more different from Trump's. But on China, the two administrations may have a lot in common. At the end of last week, Biden's team brought together the leaders of the ""Quad"" countries -- Australia, India, Japan and the US. Lisa Curtis, who was deputy assistant to Trump and a director on the National Security Council, called the Biden move ""a remarkable demonstration that it will not only build on the momentum the alliance has gained over the last three years, but also make it the centerpiece of the US' Indo-Pacific strategy,"" to counter ""the rising superpower,"" China. 
Covid turning point?

Last May 24 was supposed to be wedding day for Aliza Norwood, a physician and medical school professor in Austin, Texas, and her fianc└ Dan. ""Instead,"" Norwood recalled, ""we stood in the open doorway of his house in our sweats and laughed as a torrent of hail pelted down from the sky. The absurdity of a torrential hailstorm during a Texas summer on that particular day felt totally appropriate during those early months of the pandemic, when the whole world seemed turned upside down."" 
Since then, they've rescheduled the wedding three times, waiting for a time when a large gathering would be safe again. They are not alone of course -- millions have canceled plans and taken smart precautions against spreading the virus. But now there are glimmers of hope.
CNN's global tracker shows that an average of 11 million vaccine doses are being administered each day around the world. The US is among the nations furthest along in vaccinating its population, with 12% fully -- and another 10% partly -- vaccinated. 
Still, there are fears about variant versions of the virus that causes Covid-19, and Europe is struggling with a resurgence, along with a slow rollout of vaccines. ""The virus will always find a way around things ！ become more transmissible, less vaccine-controllable,"" wrote Dr. Kent Sepkowitz. ""Like everything else in the real world, pandemic control will require that people make good decisions."" 
What are you hoping to do once it's safe to venture out more widely? Share your thoughts here and we'll report back. 
Jill Filipovic can't wait for things to get back to ""some kind of normal."" She observed, ""I feel isolated, anxious, depressed and miserable, like an entire year of my life disappeared. But this moment -- the beginning of the end of our social halt -- is going to be one of the hardest parts for a lot of us ... like all big life transitions, a lot of people are going to react poorly to it. It's going to stir up uncertainty and fear, hope and disappointment. Change -- even change for the better -- is tough on a lot of people. Let's all go easy on each other."" 
As hard as it may be to get a vaccine appointment right now, the surprising reality is that the US will soon have an enormous glut of vaccines, wrote Michael Camu?ez, a former US Assistant Secretary of Commerce for International Trade. It has secured enough doses of the three FDA -approved vaccines for at least 500 million people, ""twice the target population.""  
""We can't let a life-saving surplus go to waste,"" Camu?ez wrote. The first place that should get America's excess vaccine? Mexico. It is one of the nation's largest trading partners and shares a 2,200 mile border with the US. ""The longer Mexico persists with a majority of its population unvaccinated, the greater the risk that a new mutation or strain of the virus could emerge and infect those in the US,"" he observed in a CNN Opinion piece published Monday. On Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration is finalizing plans to start sharing doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with Mexico and Canada.
Several nations paused the use of that vaccine after reports surfaced of blood clots among a few recipients. ""Regulators and vaccine safety experts still consider the vaccine to be overwhelmingly safe and effective,"" wrote Ines Hassan, a senior health policy researcher, ""and many of the countries that halted the use of the vaccine have since reversed course. Nevertheless, there is a great deal more work that needs to be done to rebuild trust in the vaccine.""

How did President Joe Biden win approval for a $1.9 trillion Covid-relief package that sent money to most Americans, state and local governments, schools and businesses? Credit a 47-year Georgia politician who continually demonstrates her accomplishment. Stacey Abrams became the first woman party leader in the Georgia legislature, narrowly lost a race for governor and led voter-outreach efforts that helped turn the red state blue in November and then went on to elect two Democratic senators.  
Now Abrams is focused on fighting GOP efforts to make voting harder in states where Democrats scored victories last year. ""Many Republicans have weaponized the 2020 election lies as the impetus to propose sweeping efforts to suppress voter access,"" Abrams wrote for CNN Opinion. ""The litany of proposed changes is dizzying -- from making voting by mail more difficult by eliminating no-excuse absentee voting, to limiting early voting options to restricting ballot drop box locations.""
She urged the Senate to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, even if it has to make an exception to the filibuster rule, as it did with the Covid relief package. ""Nothing is more essential to the durability of our democracy than the ability of the people to speak, regardless of ZIP code, race, age or income.""
Former Rep. Charlie Dent, a Republican, warned Democrats to take care. ""If the filibuster is eliminated -- and when Republicans regain control of the White House and Congress someday -- Democrats should expect attempts by the GOP to strike back."" The filibuster needs changes, Dent argued. ""Without a bipartisan consensus on changes to the filibuster, however, Congress will become even more tragically divided than it already is."" 
The Democratic-controlled House is facing a potentially momentous election ruling. Rita Hart, a Democratic candidate in Iowa, lost her election by six votes to Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks, according to that state's election officials. There are 22 disputed ballots, enough to oust the Republican and install Hart in the seat, if the Democratic-controlled House supports her challenge. 
Election law expert Joshua A. Douglas argued that it would be a mistake: ""Former President Donald Trump infamously refused to accept defeat in 2020, producing dangerous results for the peaceful transfer of power. He wanted Vice President Pence and Republicans in Congress to object to states that he lost. That mindset ！ that it is acceptable for a losing candidate to appeal to a favorable partisan body to challenge the results ！ undermines the legitimacy of our democracy."" 
New York (and California) states of mind
The governors of two huge coastal states faced crises -- of two very different natures -- this week that could end with them thrown them out of office. Gov. Andrew Cuomo is under investigation by the State Attorney General and a state assembly committee that could launch an effort to impeach him over sexual harassment allegations and a scandal involving the misreporting of deaths in nursing homes during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
It shouldn't have taken the recent revelations for New Yorkers to recognize that Cuomo's conduct has long been disqualifying, wrote Kara Alaimo. ""It is not news that Gov. Cuomo is a bully. While there is no excuse for his behavior, New Yorkers also bear some responsibility for repeatedly choosing to elevate him to power. Now, it's time for all of us to reevaluate the values we want our leaders to embody and withdraw support for the kinds of men who -- intentionally or unintentionally -- hold women back.""
The case ""for impeaching New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is increasingly compelling,"" wrote Lincoln Mitchell, but his rivals in the state may fear that the potential elevation of lieutenant governor Kathy Hochul, a moderate Democrat from upstate, could frustrate their hopes -- of either a progressive successor to Cuomo, or, in the Republicans' case, of a GOP governor. 
In California, Republicans may have secured enough petition signatures to force Gov. Gavin Newsom into a recall election. But it's not a partisan ""power play,"" wrote Lanhee J. Chen. ""Voters don't want to recall Newsom because of his stances on climate change, race relations or cultural wedge issues. Instead, much of the public disaffection is rooted in Newsom's mismanagement and inadequate leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic,"" including a failure to reopen many schools, reversals on reopening businesses, questions about vaccine distribution and trouble with the unemployment insurance program, according to Chen.

Nestled in the hundreds of pages of the Covid relief bill are provisions worth $5 billion that begin to reverse the historic wrongs suffered by African American farmers, wrote Peniel E. Joseph. ""Black folk have farmed, planted, tilled and cultivated agricultural and food production in America since their arrival from Africa on slave ships,"" Joseph observed. 
A century ago, black farmers owned 14% of all farms. Today they own ""less than 1% of American farmland. These disparities reflect oppressive practices after slavery that blocked Black wealth accumulation. Former enslaved African Americans, after being promised '40 acres and a mule' as compensation for decades of unpaid labor during racial slavery, were instead coerced through violence and economic intimidation into peonage and sharecropping that kept Black farmers living in perpetual debt."" The new law will relieve farmers of $4 billion in debt and invest another $1 billion in ""outreach, education, grants and investments.""  
As one injustice faced some resolution in parts of the South, another plagued it. ""Many of the primarily Black residents of Mississippi's capital, Jackson, spent weeks without running water after a cold spell burst a huge number of the city's pipes,"" wrote historian Keri Leigh Merritt. ""According to Mississippi Today, over 40,000 people, the equivalent of a sold-out game at Wrigley Field, were not able to drink, bathe or wash clothes, dishes, hands or even flush toilets -- all during a pandemic... As Mississippi Free Press reported, Governor Tate Reeves and other White lawmakers are essentially holding the Black-led, Black-populated city hostage, refusing to fund repairs."" Officials announced Wednesday that the boil water advisories were finally lifted.
For Merritt, the situation brought to mind Nina Simone's haunting song, written in 1963, ""Mississippi Goddam.""

","Where does the hate come from? That was the question on many people's minds after the killing of women at three spas in Georgia on Tuesday drew even more attention to the targeting of Asian Americans in the year since the coronavirus pandemic was declared.  A 21-year-old man was arrested and charged with shooting to death eight people, including six Asian women, in metropolitan Atlanta. While officials said they were investigating the motive -- they cited the suspect's claim he had a ""sex addiction"" -- there was growing outrage over the spate of attacks ever since the first cases of Covid-19 were reported in China, and politicians, including then-President Donald Trump, labeled it the ""China virus."" ""Politicians didn't invent prejudice, but they are exploiting it for political gain, and destroying lives in the process,"" wrote Frida Ghitis. ""During House hearings on anti-Asian violence Thursday, Texas GOP Rep. Chip Roy, somehow managed to speak approvingly of lynchings -- 'Find all the rope in Texas and get a tall oak tree...we take justice very seriously...' -- while excoriating China's regime and its role in the pandemic. It was a virtuoso performance of false equivalency and incitement. But stoking racism and fear of immigrants has become one of the go-to tools of the Trumpist Republican Party."" Jennifer Ho, the daughter of a refugee father from China and an immigrant mother from Jamaica, lived in the South for nearly 20 years. She wrote that ""To be an Asian woman in America means you can't just be what you are: a fully enfranchised human being. It means you are a blank screen on which others project their stories, especially, too often, their sexualized fantasies -- because US culture has long presented Asian women as sexualized objects for White male enjoyment."" A professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder, Ho is the president of the Association for Asian American Studies.  ""To be an Asian woman working in the US South in the massage industry means being an object, not a subject...It means further disappearing: being one of six women killed in what people aren't even calling a racially motivated crime, although can there be any doubt that it was misogyny and toxic masculinity that killed you?""  CNN's Kristie Lu Stout wrote from Hong Kong that ""hate has turned my once proud and confident Asian-American mother into a shut-in. It's not because of the virus as Covid-19 continues to rage in my home state of California. It's because she is absolutely certain that as an older Asian woman with a limp she will be targeted by violence. THIS is the America she left her homeland for?""  Adeline Chen, a features producer in Atlanta for CNN International, took a road trip with her family through the South last summer because further travels seemed risky. ""While on the surface, it might have seemed like a safe and socially distant trip, it felt anything but during this period of racial reckoning and a pandemic,"" she wrote. ""My daughter and I were often the sole minorities in RV parks surrounded by flags and signs supporting then-President Donald Trump, who routinely called Covid-19 the 'China Virus' or 'Kung Flu.'... Many people can afford to excuse the 'crazy uncle' who says racist things, but in doing so, they allow unacceptable rhetoric that has real life harmful implications for those like myself, who cannot shed their skin -- nor would want to."" In just the first two months of this year, ""Asian Americans have reported being targeted at least 500 times,"" John Avlon pointed out. ""In recent weeks, we've seen the murder of an 87-year-old Thai immigrant, Vichar Ratanapakdee, as well as the brutal assault of a 67-year-old man in San Francisco not named publicly, and the beating of 27-year-old Denny Kim in LA's Koreatown, who says his attackers shouted 'You have the Chinese Virus, go back to China.'""

President Joe Biden isn't even finished with his first 100 days in office and he's already locked in a war of words with Russian President Vladimir Putin.  On Wednesday, Biden told interviewer George Stephanopoulos that he would indeed characterize Putin as a ""killer"" and said he would ""pay a price"" after a US government intelligence report accusing Russia of meddling in the 2020 election to help Donald Trump. Putin answered Biden, ""I wish you health."" As Russia expert Daniel Treisman wrote, ""It was an interesting choice of phrase for a leader accused of having his enemies poisoned...All this suggests the depths to which US-Russia relations have sunk.""  Biden's policy on Russia couldn't be more different from Trump's. But on China, the two administrations may have a lot in common. At the end of last week, Biden's team brought together the leaders of the ""Quad"" countries -- Australia, India, Japan and the US. Lisa Curtis, who was deputy assistant to Trump and a director on the National Security Council, called the Biden move ""a remarkable demonstration that it will not only build on the momentum the alliance has gained over the last three years, but also make it the centerpiece of the US' Indo-Pacific strategy,"" to counter ""the rising superpower,"" China.  Covid turning point? Last May 24 was supposed to be wedding day for Aliza Norwood, a physician and medical school professor in Austin, Texas, and her fianc└ Dan. ""Instead,"" Norwood recalled, ""we stood in the open doorway of his house in our sweats and laughed as a torrent of hail pelted down from the sky. The absurdity of a torrential hailstorm during a Texas summer on that particular day felt totally appropriate during those early months of the pandemic, when the whole world seemed turned upside down.""  Since then, they've rescheduled the wedding three times, waiting for a time when a large gathering would be safe again. They are not alone of course -- millions have canceled plans and taken smart precautions against spreading the virus. But now there are glimmers of hope. CNN's global tracker shows that an average of 11 million vaccine doses are being administered each day around the world. The US is among the nations furthest along in vaccinating its population, with 12% fully -- and another 10% partly -- vaccinated.  Still, there are fears about variant versions of the virus that causes Covid-19, and Europe is struggling with a resurgence, along with a slow rollout of vaccines. ""The virus will always find a way around things ！ become more transmissible, less vaccine-controllable,"" wrote Dr. Kent Sepkowitz. ""Like everything else in the real world, pandemic control will require that people make good decisions.""  What are you hoping to do once it's safe to venture out more widely? Share your thoughts here and we'll report back.  Jill Filipovic can't wait for things to get back to ""some kind of normal."" She observed, ""I feel isolated, anxious, depressed and miserable, like an entire year of my life disappeared. But this moment -- the beginning of the end of our social halt -- is going to be one of the hardest parts for a lot of us ... like all big life transitions, a lot of people are going to react poorly to it. It's going to stir up uncertainty and fear, hope and disappointment. Change -- even change for the better -- is tough on a lot of people. Let's all go easy on each other.""  As hard as it may be to get a vaccine appointment right now, the surprising reality is that the US will soon have an enormous glut of vaccines, wrote Michael Camu?ez, a former US Assistant Secretary of Commerce for International Trade. It has secured enough doses of the three FDA -approved vaccines for at least 500 million people, ""twice the target population.""   ""We can't let a life-saving surplus go to waste,"" Camu?ez wrote. The first place that should get America's excess vaccine? Mexico. It is one of the nation's largest trading partners and shares a 2,200 mile border with the US. ""The longer Mexico persists with a majority of its population unvaccinated, the greater the risk that a new mutation or strain of the virus could emerge and infect those in the US,"" he observed in a CNN Opinion piece published Monday.

She publishes booklets in seven languages to help Asian Americans and others face hate crimes,21/3/2021,"The idea was born amid the coronavirus pandemic, after Esther Lim heard the term ""China virus,"" a phrase often used by former President Donald Trump, followed by a steady rise in anti-Asian crimes across the country.

Fearing for her parent's safety, Lim in April 2020 put together a booklet, ""How to Report a Hate Crime,"" with information to guide her parents in case they ever found themselves in that situation.
""I noticed that a lot of the target victims were older generation Asians who couldn't speak English well,"" Lim, 32, told CNN. ""I wanted to make sure my parents, and the rest of the Asian community, knew how to make a report or what to do if they're attacked.""
Lim published the booklet in English and translated it to Korean before she was swarmed with requests to translate it into other languages.
By March 2021 Lim had published the booklet in seven languages -- English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese and Spanish. They are free and available for download online. So far, at least 4,500 booklets have been distributed in person. Thousands more have been downloaded, Lim said.
The booklets are about 15 pages long and provide information focused on legal rights, why hate crimes should be reported and what to do when facing an attack.
Arming Asian Americans with knowledge
In addition to the coronavirus pandemic, Asian communities are facing a dangerous period of hate.
A shooting attack in the Atlanta area last week killed eight people, including six Asian women, further horrifying a community already facing misplaced blame and attacks for the pandemic. An investigation into the shooter's motive is still pending.
Lim's goal is to encourage victims of hate crimes to report them, but to also give them tips on how to safely escape and survive an attack.

She wrote separate booklets for Los Angeles and Orange County, California, as well as New York City, San Francisco and Oakland, with each one featuring specific legal information.
The booklets end with contacts for victims or witnesses of hate crimes to reach out to, along with key phrases translated for non-English speakers who need to communicate for help.
The phrases include: ""English isn't my first language,"" ""Someone is following me,"" and, ""Can you stay next to me until it is safe?""
Along with posting the booklets online, Lim distributes them to non-profit organizations in Los Angeles.
She also drops them off at senior centers, elderly clinics and houses of worship. Lim sometimes distributes whistles along with the booklets to give seniors an additional safety tool in case they ever need to signal for help.

""It makes me angry, especially because community leaders don't really do anything tangible about these hate crimes. We can keep talking about racism, but what solutions are we bringing out to individuals who need it?"" she said. ""I just wanted to do something more effective on my own to help the community. I did what I had to do.""
While Lim covers all the costs, donations sent to her GoFundMe help her print and distribute more booklets, as well as translate them into other languages. Eventually, she plans to print them in Arabic and Khmer.

Rallies across the country denounce violence against Asian Americans after Atlanta spa killings,20/3/2021,"Phan didn't know the eight people slain, six of whom were women of Asian descent. But with reports of attacks against Asian Americans against the rise, he felt like it hit close to home.
His family works in the nail salon industry. He'd heard officials say the suspect in Tuesday's shootings might have been headed to Florida to do more harm when he was arrested.
""The people, the women who perished, I see my family in them,"" he told CNN at Saturday's rally, which scores of people attended at Liberty Plaza next to the Georgia Capitol in downtown Atlanta.
Atlanta's rally was one of several scheduled around the country Saturday to honor the victims and decry violence against Asian Americans. Events were planned in New York, Houston, Columbus and elsewhere.
Authorities say they are still investigating the motive in the killings, and that the suspect claimed to investigators that the shooting wasn't racially motivated.
Eight people were fatally shot Tuesday -- four at a spa in Georgia's Cherokee County, and four more about an hour later at two spas some 30 miles away in Atlanta.
But community leaders have said Tuesday's violence has added to the fears that  Asian Americans already were feeling. Anti-Asian hate crimes have more than doubled during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.
The crimes have surged along with racist rhetoric during the pandemic. Many Asian Americans have been subjected to vitriol about the ""China virus"" or the ""kung flu"" -- even those who have never been to Asia. 
Outside one of the Atlanta spas, Xinrui Li walked up to leave flowers on Saturday. The Atlanta resident of Asian descent told CNN that she, too, was shaken by Tuesday's shootings.
""Right now I really feel very insecure, because even before this, when I was on the street sometimes people will ask me questions like, 'Why are you here?'"" she said."" Nowadays after these things happen, I really feel scared.""
Similar sentiments were expressed Friday in New York City, where people gathered at Foley Square for a candlelight vigil for the victims.
""It took a really long time for us to even be acknowledged about what was happening, and it took the deaths of eight people -- six of the women who look like me -- for people to start realizing what we've been saying (about rising violence) since last year,"" Jo-Ann Yoo, executive director of the Asian American Federation, told Spectrum News NY1 at the rally. 

President condemns rising anti-Asian hate crimes
Saturday's rally in Atlanta was attended by Georgia's two new US senators, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, who criticized a Cherokee County official's comments this week that the suspect had a ""really bad day."" 
""I'm not interested in whether or not he had a bad day,"" Warnock said, adding, ""We got to stop pretending like hate laws and laws regarding terrorism only apply to Black people and brown people and people of color and Muslims.""
""We stand resiliently in defiance of hatred and murder,"" Ossoff said. ""This is Georgia. This is love. This is compassion. This is the best of us and this is what defines the people of our state and our nation, not those who kill or scapegoat or engage in racism or hate speech or hate crimes.""
The level of planning seen in the shootings would show the suspect was motivated by more than just a ""bad day,"" retired FBI supervisory Special Agent Jim Clemente told CNN's Erin Burnett on Friday.
""His actions show that he targeted a particular type of person on this particular day, and not only did he do it at one location, but he went to a second and a third location,"" Clemente said. 
President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris visited Atlanta on Friday and condemned the shootings and the rising number of hate crimes against Asian Americans.
Some public officials have said they want prosecutors to consider hate crime charges, whether on the basis of race or sex, both of which are covered in Georgia's hate crime law. 
While in Atlanta, Biden and Harris did not explicitly state that they considered the shootings a hate crime. But they noted that whatever the shooter's motivation, the killings come as hate crimes are rising against Asian Americans.
""The conversation we had today with the (Asian American and Pacific Islander) leaders, and that we're hearing all across the country, is that hate and violence often hide in plain sight. It's often met with silence,"" Biden said. ""That's been true throughout our history, but that has to change because our silence is complicity.""
During Biden and Harris's visit, community leaders talked with the President and vice president for more than an hour about their concerns about crimes against Asians and other issues, Georgia state Rep. Bee Nguyen told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront.""
Suspect held on murder charges
Suspect Robert Aaron Long, 21, of Woodstock, was arrested Tuesday night in a traffic stop 150 miles south of Atlanta.
Long told police he believed he had a sex addiction and that he saw the spas as ""a temptation ... that he wanted to eliminate,"" said Cherokee County sheriff's Capt. Jay Baker on Wednesday. He claimed the attacks weren't racially motivated, Baker said.
But Atlanta police have said it is still too early to know the suspect's motive. And Cherokee County District Attorney Shannon Wallace said the investigation is ongoing and appropriate charges will be brought.
Long is being held without opportunity for bail in Cherokee County, where he faces four counts of murder with malice, one count of attempted murder, one count of aggravated assault and five counts of using a firearm while committing a felony.
He has been charged with four counts of murder in connection with the two spa shootings in Atlanta, according to Atlanta police.
Victims leave behind families: 'She was one of my best friends'
The names of all eight people slain have been released.
Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, of Acworth; Paul Andre Michels, 54, of Atlanta; Xiaojie Tan, 49, of Kennesaw; and Daoyou Feng, 44, were fatally shot at the site of Tuesday's first shooting, Youngs Asian Massage in Cherokee County.
Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, of Acworth, was also shot at Youngs Asian Massage but survived.
""This person took it upon himself to massacre hardworking, good people,"" Tan's former husband, Michael Webb, told CNN in an interview Saturday. ""I don't understand that. I don't think it's possible that a human being can do that."" 
He described Tan as a person who was ""determined not only to have a career, but to own a business."" And over the past couple years, Webb said that Tan had told him she would be able to retire soon.
""She worked so hard,"" he said. ""I'm sad that it ended in an instant, while she was working hard, and she'll never get to enjoy that.""
About 30 miles away and within an hour of the first shooting, four Asian women were killed in Atlanta -- three at the Gold Massage Spa, and one at the Aroma Therapy Spa across the street, authorities said.
The four Atlanta victims were: Soon Chung Park, 74; Hyun Jung Grant, 51; Suncha Kim, 69; and Yong Ae Yue, 63, according to the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office.
Three died of gunshot wounds to the head, and one died of a gunshot wound to the chest, the medical examiner's office said.
One of the four victims in Atlanta was a South Korean citizen and permanent resident of the US, according to Kwangsuk Lee, South Korea's deputy consulate general in Atlanta. The other three are believed to be Americans of Korean ethnicity, Lee told CNN on Friday.
Grant was a ""single mother who dedicated her whole life to providing for my brother and I,"" her son, Randy Park, wrote on a GoFundMe page.
""She was one of my best friends and the strongest influence on who we are today,"" Park wrote.
The GoFundMe page, set up for Grant's two sons, had raised more than $2.2 million from more than 65,000 donors as of Saturday evening. GoFundMe told CNN the page is verified; Park did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.
The page says the donated money will pay for food, rent and other monthly bills. It says the brothers now only have each other in the US, with every other relative in South Korea.
In an update on Friday, Park expressed how grateful he was for the support.
""This doesn't represent even a fragment of how I feel,"" he wrote. ""My mother can rest easy knowing I have the support of the world with me.""
Yaun's husband, Mario Gonzalez, told the Mundo Hispanico newspaper that he and his wife were at the spa to get massages, and she was in a separate room when the shooting started.
""About an hour in ... I heard the shots. I didn't see anything, only I started to think it was in the room where my wife was,"" he told the newspaper.
""(The shooter) took the most valuable thing I had in my life,"" Gonzalez said. ""He left me with only pain.""

""Right now I really feel very insecure, because even before this, when I was on the street sometimes people will ask me questions like, 'Why are you here?'"" she said."" Nowadays after these things happen, I really feel scared."" Similar sentiments were expressed Friday in New York City, where people gathered at Foley Square for a candlelight vigil for the victims. ""It took a really long time for us to even be acknowledged about what was happening, and it took the deaths of eight people -- six of the women who look like me -- for people to start realizing what we've been saying (about rising violence) since last year,"" Jo-Ann Yoo, executive director of the Asian American Federation, told Spectrum News NY1 at the rally.  President condemns rising anti-Asian hate crimes Saturday's rally in Atlanta was attended by Georgia's two new US senators, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, who criticized a Cherokee County official's comments this week that the suspect had a ""really bad day.""  ""I'm not interested in whether or not he had a bad day,"" Warnock said, adding, ""We got to stop pretending like hate laws and laws regarding terrorism only apply to Black people and brown people and people of color and Muslims."" ""We stand resiliently in defiance of hatred and murder,"" Ossoff said. ""This is Georgia. This is love. This is compassion. This is the best of us and this is what defines the people of our state and our nation, not those who kill or scapegoat or engage in racism or hate speech or hate crimes."" The level of planning seen in the shootings would show the suspect was motivated by more than just a ""bad day,"" retired FBI supervisory Special Agent Jim Clemente told CNN's Erin Burnett on Friday. ""His actions show that he targeted a particular type of person on this particular day, and not only did he do it at one location, but he went to a second and a third location,"" Clemente said.  President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris visited Atlanta on Friday and condemned the shootings and the rising number of hate crimes against Asian Americans. Some public officials have said they want prosecutors to consider hate crime charges, whether on the basis of race or sex, both of which are covered in Georgia's hate crime law.  While in Atlanta, Biden and Harris did not explicitly state that they considered the shootings a hate crime. But they noted that whatever the shooter's motivation, the killings come as hate crimes are rising against Asian Americans. ""The conversation we had today with the (Asian American and Pacific Islander) leaders, and that we're hearing all across the country, is that hate and violence often hide in plain sight. It's often met with silence,"" Biden said. ""That's been true throughout our history, but that has to change because our silence is complicity."" During Biden and Harris's visit, community leaders talked with the President and vice president for more than an hour about their concerns about crimes against Asians and other issues, Georgia state Rep. Bee Nguyen told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" Suspect held on murder charges Suspect Robert Aaron Long, 21, of Woodstock, was arrested Tuesday night in a traffic stop 150 miles south of Atlanta. Long told police he believed he had a sex addiction and that he saw the spas as ""a temptation ... that he wanted to eliminate,"" said Cherokee County sheriff's Capt. Jay Baker on Wednesday. He claimed the attacks weren't racially motivated, Baker said. But Atlanta police have said it is still too early to know the suspect's motive. And Cherokee County District Attorney Shannon Wallace said the investigation is ongoing and appropriate charges will be brought. Long is being held without opportunity for bail in Cherokee County, where he faces four counts of murder with malice, one count of attempted murder, one count of aggravated assault and five counts of using a firearm while committing a felony. He has been charged with four counts of murder in connection with the two spa shootings in Atlanta, according to Atlanta police. Victims leave behind families: 'She was one of my best friends' The names of all eight people slain have been released. Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, of Acworth; Paul Andre Michels, 54, of Atlanta; Xiaojie Tan, 49, of Kennesaw; and Daoyou Feng, 44, were fatally shot at the site of Tuesday's first shooting, Youngs Asian Massage in Cherokee County. Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, of Acworth, was also shot at Youngs Asian Massage but survived. ""This person took it upon himself to massacre hardworking, good people,"" Tan's former husband, Michael Webb, told CNN in an interview Saturday. ""I don't understand that. I don't think it's possible that a human being can do that.""  He described Tan as a person who was ""determined not only to have a career, but to own a business."" And over the past couple years, Webb said that Tan had told him she would be able to retire soon. ""She worked so hard,"" he said. ""I'm sad that it ended in an instant, while she was working hard, and she'll never get to enjoy that."" About 30 miles away and within an hour of the first shooting, four Asian women were killed in Atlanta -- three at the Gold Massage Spa, and one at the Aroma Therapy Spa across the street, authorities said. The four Atlanta victims were: Soon Chung Park, 74; Hyun Jung Grant, 51; Suncha Kim, 69; and Yong Ae Yue, 63, according to the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office. Three died of gunshot wounds to the head, and one died of a gunshot wound to the chest, the medical examiner's office said. One of the four victims in Atlanta was a South Korean citizen and permanent resident of the US, according to Kwangsuk Lee, South Korea's deputy consulate general in Atlanta. The other three are believed to be Americans of Korean ethnicity, Lee told CNN on Friday. Grant was a ""single mother who dedicated her whole life to providing for my brother and I,"" her son, Randy Park, wrote on a GoFundMe page. ""She was one of my best friends and the strongest influence on who we are today,"" Park wrote. The GoFundMe page, set up for Grant's two sons, had raised more than $2.2 million from more than 65,000 donors as of Saturday evening. GoFundMe told CNN the page is verified; Park did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. The page says the donated money will pay for food, rent and other monthly bills. It says the brothers now only have each other in the US, with every other relative in South Korea. In an update on Friday, Park expressed how grateful he was for the support. ""This doesn't represent even a fragment of how I feel,"" he wrote. ""My mother can rest easy knowing I have the support of the world with me."" Yaun's husband, Mario Gonzalez, told the Mundo Hispanico newspaper that he and his wife were at the spa to get massages, and she was in a separate room when the shooting started. ""About an hour in ... I heard the shots. I didn't see anything, only I started to think it was in the room where my wife was,"" he told the newspaper. ""(The shooter) took the most valuable thing I had in my life,"" Gonzalez said. ""He left me with only pain.""",us,US
Biden condemns 'skyrocketing' hate crimes against Asian Americans in wake of deadly shooting,20/3/2021,"Biden said hate crimes against Asian Americans have been ""skyrocketing"" since the coronavirus pandemic began more than a year ago and that the country cannot be silent in the face of the hate and violence. 
""Our silence is?complicity.?We cannot be complicit.?We have to speak out. We have to?act,"" Biden said, speaking from Emory University in Atlanta. 
He said Asian Americans have been ""attacked, blamed, scapegoated and harassed. They've been verbally assaulted, physically assaulted, killed.""
Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Atlanta on Friday to meet with Asian American leaders in the wake of the deadly shooting. They had originally planned to travel to Atlanta to tout the benefits of the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 economic relief package that Biden recently signed into law, but the White House scrapped plans for a rally after the shooting. 
""The conversation we had today?with the (Asian American and Pacific Islander) leaders, and that?we're hearing all across the?country, is that hate and?violence often hide in plain?sight. It's often met with silence,"" Biden said. ""That's been true throughout our?history, but that has to change?because our silence is?complicity.""
Biden urged Congress to pass the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act, which he has said would expedite the federal government's response to hate crimes that have risen during the pandemic, support state and local governments to improve hate crimes reporting and make information on hate crimes more accessible to Asian American communities.
Biden and Harris did not explicitly state that they considered the shootings earlier this week a hate crime. But they noted that whatever the motivation of the shooter, the killings come amid rising hate crimes against Asian Americans in the United States. 
""Racism is real in America and it has always been. Xenophobia is real in America and always has been -- sexism too,"" said Harris, who is America's first Black and South Asian vice president.
The vice president said: ""For the last year, we've had people in positions of incredible power scapegoating Asian Americans -- people with the biggest pulpits spreading this kind of hate. Ultimately this is about who we are as a nation. This is about how we treat people with dignity and respect.""
'Very somber' meeting with AAPI leaders
During a meeting with leaders of the Asian American Pacific Islander -- sometimes shortened to AAPI -- community, Biden echoed Harris in condemning the rhetoric from powerful political leaders, according to one attendee. Stephanie Cho, the executive director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said former President Donald Trump's name came up repeatedly during Biden's hourlong meeting with the group.
Biden acknowledged Trump's contributions to a rise in hate against Asian Americans, Cho told CNN's Jeff Zeleny. 
As for what Cho hopes to see from the administration, she said: ""I'd like to see it be beyond this moment. And that as much as the former President called it the 'China virus' and scapegoated Asian Americans and really fueled this racism around Asian Americans, I would like to see the Biden administration come out just as strongly but in support of Asian Americans.""
Biden said he would work as ""much as possible"" to roll back that rhetoric.
""He definitely said that they were definitely harmful,"" Cho said of when the topic of Trump's statements came up in the meeting.
""And it's his position and his administration to completely roll back all of that,"" Cho added.
Cho described the meeting as ""very somber"" but said that Biden was ""trying to understand"" the issue and to hear directly from AAPI leaders.
Biden would not describe the shootings as a hate crime yet, and Cho said she understood why he has to take that position, although she feels differently.
Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois sent two letters to Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray this week asking for a review of hate crimes against Asian Americans, as she lobbies the Biden administration to prioritize the issue. She asked for them to review why some hate crimes against the AAPI community are not reported as such. 
Duckworth also called Harris this week, a source familiar with the call told CNN. The source declined to provide details of the pair's conversation, but added broadly, ""The administration is keeping an open line out to everyone. We want to keep talking and figure out ways to engage with the AAPI community."" The call was first reported by Politico.
A trip to a key state
Prior to meeting with the AAPI leaders, Biden and Harris visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is headquartered in Atlanta, and received an update on the pandemic from health and medical experts. 
""This is a war and you are the front-line troops,"" Biden told the CDC staff. ""I came here to say thank you.""
The visit came as the Biden administration reached its goal of 100 million shots in arms. 

Georgia has emerged as a key political state for Democrats. Biden narrowly won there in the presidential race and Democrats subsequently won two Senate seats there earlier this year, which gave the party control of the chamber -- enabling passage of Biden's sweeping Covid-19 law. 
Biden and Harris met with those Democrats, Georgia Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, during their trip, White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, as well as Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and former Democratic Georgia gubernatorial candidate?and voting rights champion Stacey Abrams. 
Biden touted passage of his administration's Covid relief package in his remarks, boasting that Americans who've already seen direct payments from the package ""can thank Senators Warnock and Ossoff -- but for their votes, that would not have happened.""
""If anyone ever wondered if voting can change your country, Georgia just proved it can. Because when you elected two new United States senators, it made it possible to pass the American Rescue Plan -- landmark legislation to not only meet the emergency we're in but transform this nation,"" he said.
Both Warnock and Ossoff narrowly won their seats from incumbent Republicans in runoff elections, flipping the balance of control in the Senate and paving the way for passage of the administration's American Rescue Plan, which cleared the Senate without any Republican support.
In a statement following the meeting, Warnock and Ossoff pointed to the American Rescue Plan as a bright point in a tough week. They said the meeting consisted of discussions about how the legislation will affect Georgians -- from free vaccines to direct payments to Peach State residents who qualify -- and looked toward investing in infrastructure as a next step.
""As Georgia unites in grief after this week's massacre, the President and Vice President made clear today that they are here for Georgia, and that together we will defeat Covid-19, rebuild our economy, and re-unite our country,"" Ossoff said.
Warnock added, ""I look forward to welcoming (Biden and Harris) back to Georgia, and working with them to make sure the robust relief we passed！from expanded tax refunds for working families, to debt relief for farmers of color, to strong federal incentives to expand Medicaid in our state and more！is reaching Georgians where they are to help us continue moving beyond the health and economic devastation of this once-in-a-century pandemic."" 
Abrams has devoted years to expanding the electorate and boosting turnout in Georgia, a typically reliable red state. Biden was the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Georgia since 1992. 
Georgia is ground zero for one of the country's biggest fights over voting rights. Georgia Republicans are trying to pass new laws to make voting more difficult -- an expansive new voting bill unveiled on Wednesday would give the state broad powers over local election officials, set limits on weekend early voting and add voter ID requirements for absentee ballots.

Spring equinox 2021: Hope rises on the horizon,20/3/2021,,"For people in the Northern Hemisphere who huddled against a sometimes brutal winter, hope is here. Spring equinox 2021 arrives on Saturday, March 20, bringing its nearly perfect balance of daytime and nighttime all around the world. Last year, the equinox made an earlier-than-usual arrival. Because of the peculiarities of the calendar, it was the earliest arrival of a spring equinox in 124 years. But decades from now, that equinox will best be remembered as the time when much of world had just started hunkering down against the Covid-19 pandemic.  It was a disconcerting time. The call of the spring equinox is ancient and primal. For millennia, humankind has tracked the sun and the seasons and celebrated the promise of renewal and rebirth by joining together outdoors. In 2020, we were compelled to do the opposite, retreating indoors and into isolation to slow the march of the coronavirus. But 2021 offers signs of a return to normalcy. The spring equinox is going back to its more usual date of March 20. And with more Covid-19 vaccinations being distributed by the day, the hopes that spring traditionally represent -- rebirth and renewal -- seem within our grasp. Below are some scientific and cultural tidbits about the spring equinox. And we'll also have a noteworthy asteroid passing through the neighborhood the next day that you'll want to know about. Spring equinox has another name If you ever hear anyone say ""vernal equinox,"" it means the same thing. The term equinox comes from the Latin word ""equinoxium,"" meaning ""equality between day and night."" And vernal also comes from Latin and means spring.  Precisely when does the spring equinox happen? The equinox will arrive at 9:37 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) March 20. For people in places such as Montreal and Miami, that's 5:37 a.m. local time. Out in San Diego and Vancouver, that means it arrives at 2:37 a.m. Now for denizens of Lisbon and London, that will be 9:37 a.m. Going farther east, Istanbul clocks in at 12:37 p.m., and Mumbai marks the exact event at 3:07 p.m. For residents of Tokyo, it spills into late afternoon at 6:37 p.m. You can click here to see a listing of major cities on the website timeanddate.com.  Or click here to look up where you live. For others, fall is in the air While folks in the Northern Hemisphere are looking forward to longer days, warmer weather, flowers and a burst of greenery, people living south of the equator are heading into fall. So for Argentinians, South Africans and Australians, among others, this is a time to look forward to cooler weather and the joys of autumn. For people who reside near the equator (in places such as Quito, Ecuador, or Singapore), none of this is a big deal. They get roughly 12 hours of daylight and nighttime year round.  Why does spring equinox happen? The Earth rotates along an imaginary line that runs from North Pole to South Pole. It's called the axis, and this rotation is what gives us day and night. However, the axis tilts at 23.5 degrees, as NASA explains. That positions one hemisphere of the planet to get more sunlight than the other for half of the year's orbit around the sun. This discrepancy in sunlight is what triggers the seasons.  The effect is at its maximum in late June and late December. Those are the solstices, and they have the most extreme differences between day and night, especially near the poles. (That's why it stays dark for so long each day during the winter in places such as Scandinavia and Alaska.) But since the winter solstice three months ago in December, you've noticed that our days have been getting longer in the Northern Hemisphere and the nights shorter. And now here we are at the spring equinox! Going forward, the Northern Hemisphere will be more exposed to the sun than the Southern Hemisphere. That's why it gets increasingly hot as we head toward the summer solstice in June. By the way, the equinoxes aren't exactly 'equal' It turns out you actually get a little more daylight than darkness on the equinox -- and how much so depends where you are on the planet.  How does that happen when it's supposed to be 12 hours of day and 12 hours night? As the US National Weather Service explains, the ""nearly"" equal hours of day and night are because of the complex way a sunrise is measured and the refraction of sunlight in our atmosphere. This bending of light rays ""causes the sun to appear above the horizon when the actual position of the sun is below the horizon.""  The day is a bit longer at higher latitudes than at the equator because it takes the sun longer to rise and set the closer you get to the poles.  We got that truly equal day/night split a few days before the official spring equinox. That's called the equilux.  Get oriented If you're a sky watcher, the website EarthSky points out the equinoxes -- spring or autumn -- are a superb time to orient yourself. The equinoxes are the only two times a year the sun rises due east and sets due west for everyone on the planet. EarthSky says the equinox is ""a good day for finding east and west from your yard or other favorite site for watching the sky. Just go outside around sunset or sunrise and notice the location of the sun on the horizon with respect to familiar landmarks."" Celebrations and traditions Because of the pandemic, celebrations will continue to be canceled or altered to fit safety needs. In England, the mysterious stone structure of Stonehenge usually plays host to crowds during equinoxes and solstices. But because of the winter Covid-19 surge, the United Kingdom went into another lockdown. Stonehenge is set to reopen to the public on April 12, according to the English Heritage website, too late for this year's vernal equinox.  Mexico's Chich└n Itz│, normally a very popular and crowded Mayan site during solstices and equinoxes, will be closed to visitors from March 20 to March 22 (Saturday to Monday), according to the Yucatan Times. It closed during 2020's spring equinox, too. This year, it will reopen to visitors Tuesday, March 23. So while some of the big draws are closed off, localities have plenty of safe ways to mark the coming of spring. For example, Pike Place Market in Seattle will be celebrating its 24th annual Daffodil Day. When shoppers visit the market, they will get a free bundle of daffodils. Cultures around the world mark the occasion.  Nowruz is the Persian New Year.  Also known as Nauryz, Navruz or Nowrouz, it means ""new day."" The new year will ring in on Saturday, March 20.  It's no coincidence it falls on the first day of spring. The Iranian calendar is a solar calendar, meaning time is determined, through astronomical observations, by Earth's movement around the sun. So, the first day of the year always kicks off with the vernal equinox.  It's a celebration of new beginnings: wishing prosperity and welcoming the future while shedding away the past. That's why families use this time to deep clean their homes and closets and buy fresh clothing.  In China, trying to stand an egg upright is a popular game during the spring equinox, according to VisitBeijing.com. The custom is thought to go back thousands of years, and it's believed that if people can get an egg to stand, they will have good luck. And people across China eat local spring vegetables. We'll have a passerby on Sunday For people who like all things science and space, there's a day-after-equinox bonus.  The largest asteroid that has been predicted to make a close approach of Earth in 2021 will zip by -- from a safe distance, we must add -- on Sunday, according to NASA. Scientists estimate the asteroid is between 1,300 and 2,230 feet wide. Known as 2001 FO32, the near-Earth asteroid will be 1.25 million miles away, or more than five times the distance between Earth and the moon, during its closest approach.  It will also be moving much faster than most asteroids that fly by our planet, zooming by at 77,000 miles per hour. Its closest approach will be at 12:03 p.m. ET Sunday. ",travel,TRAVEL
"Biden administration off to a combative start with tough rhetoric on Russia, China",20/3/2021,"""Mm-hmm,"" Biden told ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, nodding slightly, ""I do.""
Some of the President's advisers who share his assessment were still surprised by his answer, which overshot what many believed would be Biden's opening bid in dealing with an increasingly adversarial counterpart.
They anticipated -- correctly, it turns out -- an outsized response from Moscow. The Kremlin ended up recalling its ambassador to the US for the first time in more than 20 years. Putin responded with a dry wish for ""good health"" and a proposal for a live televised debate. 
The White House said Biden had no regrets in labeling Putin a killer. But his response set the tone for what would become a marquee week for the young administration in establishing a surprisingly combative foreign policy, designed to reassert US strength and moral authority while showily antagonizing leaders who have drifted toward authoritarianism. 
Two days later, senior Biden officials engaged in open sparring with their Chinese counterparts in the ballroom of the Hotel Captain Cook in Anchorage, Alaska, animosity rarely seen so plainly on the world stage. US officials, who already had low expectations for the meeting, voiced little surprise the Chinese delegation entered the meeting loaded for bear. 
If the two episodes shared something in common, it was the apparent desire to publicly signal to Moscow, Beijing and skeptical Americans alike that Biden will not be pushed over, even if the result is dramatic deterioration of relations. As both countries seek to paint the US as weakened -- by political divisions, a botched response to coronavirus and economic instability -- Biden has used the country's moral rooting as proof of its continued global standing, setting up a contentious contest of values even as the tone turns increasingly bitter. 
Administration officials are now working to finalize a package of sanctions to punish Russia for its attempts to meddle in the US election, its role in the massive SolarWinds hack and its placing of bounties on US troops serving in Afghanistan, which could be unveiled as soon as next week, according to two administration officials.
But sanctions on Putin's regime have done little to change his behavior so far. So the White House has also said to expect an ""unseen"" response to the hack, which could signal use of the United States' own cyber capabilities to stage a retaliation. Some officials have suggested the possibility of hacking potentially embarrassing information about Russian leaders and leaking it.
Biden's options for countering China are less clear, with sanctions difficult to make effective. The White House is continuing to explore ways to counter China's growing technological advantages by changing US industrial policy. It's also moving to counter Chinese aggression in Asia by better enlisting allies in the region.
In both cases, a more explicit focus on calling out anti-democratic behavior has been clear, prompting angry responses from the other side. Both episodes this week seemed to illustrate a desire to make a hard break from former President Donald Trump -- who largely avoided raising issues like human rights and sought to flatter both Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping -- even if the undiplomatic sparring recalled some of Trump's more chaotic outings on the world stage. 
""The larger story here is that President Biden has been saying that we need to stand up for democracy, we are going to compete with these authoritarian countries. You saw rounds one and two this week with the Russians and Chinese,"" said Nicholas Burns, a former US ambassador and senior State Department official who is said to be a leading contender to become Biden's ambassador to China. ""The United States is standing up for itself after four years of not doing that. And I think it's been an important week to reposition the United States.""
Where that repositioning goes from here remains something of an open question, and Russia and China present vastly different challenges. One is the diminished former cold war adversary whose disruption of cyber networks has proved deeply destabilizing; the other is a rising power whose economy and military could overtake the US in the coming decades.
The US will have to cooperate to some degree with each; Biden has already quickly renegotiated the New START nuclear treaty with Russia and hopes to work with China on climate change. 
But this week's conflicts raise questions on how far that can extend. 
Both China and Russia have seized on perceived weaknesses inside the United States as evidence the country is waning in power, including the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol and the pandemic-prompted economic downturn. They have defended their own human rights abuses by pointing to US treatment of minorities, both historic and present-day. 
Biden, and by extension his national security team, have made improving those factors central to their foreign policy. And Secretary of State Antony Blinken, channeling a phrase Biden uses often, told his Chinese counterparts that ""it's never a good bet to bet against America.""
How to sanction Russia
But behind the scenes there are other ways the administration is working to counter its foes. Biden signaled in his interview that punishment on Russia -- both for its role in the SolarWinds attack and its efforts to influence the US elections -- was coming soon.
""He will pay a price. We had a long talk, he and I,"" Biden said of his first talk with Putin. ""The conversation started off, I said, 'I know you and you know me. If I establish this occurred, then be prepared.' ""
Discussions about the response to the devastating SolarWinds security breach of at least nine federal agencies and dozens of private businesses are still ongoing, but could come before the end of the month, officials said.
The package will likely include sanctions and a cyber component, as well as other options that make clear just how serious the Biden administration views Russia's actions more broadly, officials have told CNN. Options in the past for responding to Russian cyber aggression have included using technology to expose Putin's hidden assets or moves that would help dissidents get their message through government censors.
Earlier this month, the Biden administration imposed a raft of sanctions on Russian officials and entities in response to the poisoning and imprisonment of opposition leader Alexey Navalny. The actions -- taken in coordination with the European Union, which also unveiled sanctions -- represented the first significant move against Moscow since Biden became President.
Both steps would mark a clear departure from the strategy of the Trump administration, which failed to impose penalties over the poisoning and shied away from directly confronting Russia. 
Tough talk with China
So, too, has the Biden administration more aggressively sought to call out China for its actions in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet and Xinjiang province, steps Trump stopped short of doing publicly. 
Those arguments were the crux of the disagreement at the start of Thursday's meeting in Anchorage, where Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan raised the issues and said the US and its allies would push back against Chinese authoritarianism.
""That's a subject matter they're very, very sensitive to because they think it's other countries meddling in their internal affairs and they're trying to push back and say basically: who are you, the United States, to lecture us on human rights and civil rights and so forth when you have your own problems?"" said Gary Locke, a former US ambassador to China.
""They're feeling their strength, they're feeling their economic rebound,"" Locke went on. ""Their country has really come back, life is almost back to normal in china whereas here in the United States we're still struggling with the coronavirus and our economy is still in tatters, although it's also rebounding. So China's feeling a bit of strength and confidence.""
By the end of the first day of talks, the Chinese had accused the US delegation of being ""condescending"" in its tone, while a US official said the representatives from Beijing seemed ""intent on grandstanding"" and accused them of breaking protocol.
One official suggested the Chinese were looking to embarrass the Americans on their own soil. The site in Alaska was selected in part because the US wanted to stage the first high-level meeting on their own terms; an invitation to meet in Washington was regarded as a step too far, making Anchorage a suitable alternative.
After the initial sparring, both sides insisted the mood was better behind closed doors than what cameras caught transpiring. And Biden said Friday he was ""proud"" of Blinken.
The President's endorsement sent a strong signal to the Chinese that the tone struck at Thursday's meeting -- a forceful US critique of China's behavior domestically in places like Xinjiang and overseas, as well as Blinken's pushback -- has the full backing of the administration and that US officials are speaking with one voice.
With Biden, however, surprise escalations are not out of the question. Known for going off-script, it will be his own assessments of the global stage that dictate his administration policy going forward.
For now, his primary focus appears to be making plain the differences he is offering from Trump, who strained global alliances and confounded the national security establishment, including when he met with Putin alone and demanded the notes of his interpreter.
Describing his lengthy meetings with Xi when both were serving as vice president on Friday, Biden made clear that he was taking a different approach.
""I met with him, I guess, they tell me, 24, 25 hours alone, just me and an interpreter, and he and an interpreter,"" he said. ""And, by the way, I handed in all my notes.""
","President Joe Biden didn't waste a beat when asked this week whether he believed his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin was a ""killer."" ""Mm-hmm,"" Biden told ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, nodding slightly, ""I do."" Some of the President's advisers who share his assessment were still surprised by his answer, which overshot what many believed would be Biden's opening bid in dealing with an increasingly adversarial counterpart. They anticipated -- correctly, it turns out -- an outsized response from Moscow. The Kremlin ended up recalling its ambassador to the US for the first time in more than 20 years. Putin responded with a dry wish for ""good health"" and a proposal for a live televised debate.  The White House said Biden had no regrets in labeling Putin a killer. But his response set the tone for what would become a marquee week for the young administration in establishing a surprisingly combative foreign policy, designed to reassert US strength and moral authority while showily antagonizing leaders who have drifted toward authoritarianism.  Two days later, senior Biden officials engaged in open sparring with their Chinese counterparts in the ballroom of the Hotel Captain Cook in Anchorage, Alaska, animosity rarely seen so plainly on the world stage. US officials, who already had low expectations for the meeting, voiced little surprise the Chinese delegation entered the meeting loaded for bear.  If the two episodes shared something in common, it was the apparent desire to publicly signal to Moscow, Beijing and skeptical Americans alike that Biden will not be pushed over, even if the result is dramatic deterioration of relations. As both countries seek to paint the US as weakened -- by political divisions, a botched response to coronavirus and economic instability -- Biden has used the country's moral rooting as proof of its continued global standing, setting up a contentious contest of values even as the tone turns increasingly bitter.  Administration officials are now working to finalize a package of sanctions to punish Russia for its attempts to meddle in the US election, its role in the massive SolarWinds hack and its placing of bounties on US troops serving in Afghanistan, which could be unveiled as soon as next week, according to two administration officials. But sanctions on Putin's regime have done little to change his behavior so far. So the White House has also said to expect an ""unseen"" response to the hack, which could signal use of the United States' own cyber capabilities to stage a retaliation. Some officials have suggested the possibility of hacking potentially embarrassing information about Russian leaders and leaking it. Biden's options for countering China are less clear, with sanctions difficult to make effective. The White House is continuing to explore ways to counter China's growing technological advantages by changing US industrial policy. It's also moving to counter Chinese aggression in Asia by better enlisting allies in the region. In both cases, a more explicit focus on calling out anti-democratic behavior has been clear, prompting angry responses from the other side. Both episodes this week seemed to illustrate a desire to make a hard break from former President Donald Trump -- who largely avoided raising issues like human rights and sought to flatter both Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping -- even if the undiplomatic sparring recalled some of Trump's more chaotic outings on the world stage.  ""The larger story here is that President Biden has been saying that we need to stand up for democracy, we are going to compete with these authoritarian countries. You saw rounds one and two this week with the Russians and Chinese,"" said Nicholas Burns, a former US ambassador and senior State Department official who is said to be a leading contender to become Biden's ambassador to China. ""The United States is standing up for itself after four years of not doing that. And I think it's been an important week to reposition the United States."" Where that repositioning goes from here remains something of an open question, and Russia and China present vastly different challenges. One is the diminished former cold war adversary whose disruption of cyber networks has proved deeply destabilizing; the other is a rising power whose economy and military could overtake the US in the coming decades. The US will have to cooperate to some degree with each; Biden has already quickly renegotiated the New START nuclear treaty with Russia and hopes to work with China on climate change.  But this week's conflicts raise questions on how far that can extend.  Both China and Russia have seized on perceived weaknesses inside the United States as evidence the country is waning in power, including the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol and the pandemic-prompted economic downturn.

Video appears to show Atlanta shooting suspect parking in front of spa,20/3/2021,"The video, provided to CNN by Gabby's Boutique, shows a Hyundai pull into a parking spot.

Live updates: Asian American communities on edge after shootings
Robert Aaron Long, 21, is being held in connection with Tuesday's shootings at Youngs Asian Spa near the city of Woodstock, where four people were killed, and two spas in Atlanta, where four more were killed. Six of the eight people slain were women of Asian descent, authorities said.
Long claimed responsibility for the shootings, according to the sheriff's office in Cherokee County, where he faces four counts of murder with malice, one count of attempted murder, one count of aggravated assault and five counts of using a firearm while committing a felony. He also has been charged with four counts of murder in Atlanta, police there said.
The suspect, arrested Tuesday night in a traffic stop 150 miles south of Atlanta, told police he believed he had a sex addiction and that he saw the spas as ""a temptation ... that he wanted to eliminate,"" Cherokee County sheriff's Capt. Jay Baker said. 
But Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant has said it is still too early to know a motive, and Cherokee County District Attorney Shannon Wallace said the investigation is ongoing and appropriate charges will be brought.
President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris visited Atlanta on Friday and condemned the shootings and the rising number of hate crimes against Asian Americans.
Also Friday, the church attended by the suspect released a statement condemning the killings ""in the strongest possible terms"" and saying ""no blame can be placed upon the victims.""
In its statement, Crabapple First Baptist Church confirmed Long's family were members, and said the killings were the ""result of a sinful heart and depraved mind."" It said the violence and Long's actions also ""directly contradict his own confession of faith"" and were ""antithetical to everything that we believe and teach as a church.""
Meanwhile, some public officials say they're pressing investigators to consider hate crime charges against Long.
During Biden and Harris's visit Atlanta on Friday, community leaders talked with the President and vice president for more than an hour about their concerns about crimes against Asians and other issues, Georgia state Rep. Bee Nguyen told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront.""
While in Atlanta, Biden and Harris did not explicitly state that they considered the shootings a hate crime. But they noted that whatever the shooter's motivation, the killings come as hate crimes are rising against Asian Americans.
""The conversation we had today with the (Asian American and Pacific Islander) leaders, and that we're hearing all across the country, is that hate and violence often hide in plain sight. It's often met with silence,"" Biden said. ""That's been true throughout our history, but that has to change because our silence is complicity.""
While FBI Director Christopher Wray said the attacks don't appear to be racially motivated, advocacy groups have argued that it is too soon to make that determination. And shootings don't have to be racially motivated to constitute a hate crime in Georgia.
""It looked like a hate crime to me,"" Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said on ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Thursday. ""This was targeted at Asian spas. Six of the women who were killed were Asian so it's difficult to see it as anything but that."" 
""Sex"" is a hate crime category under Georgia law. If Long was targeting women out of hatred for them or scapegoating them for his own problems, it could potentially be a hate crime.
Long had previously frequented the two Atlanta spas, and he bought the gun used in the shooting the day of the incident, Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Charles Hampton Jr. said Thursday.
Communities and nation grapple with fear and grief
Flowers have lined the businesses that were the scenes of the violence, but with the rise in animosity and hate directed at Asians and Asian Americans, the emotional toll has been felt across the nation.
Anti-Asian hate crimes have more than doubled during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.
The violence has surged amid racist rhetoric during the pandemic -- some popularized by former President Donald Trump. Many Asian Americans have been subjected to vitriol about the ""China virus"" or the ""kung flu"" -- even those who have never been to Asia.
""Such vicious, unconscionable acts of violence cut at the very core of our country and the values on which it was founded,"" former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said Thursday. ""As we await the findings of a thorough investigation, the critical work to combat the haunting rise of hatred against the AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) community must intensify with the immediacy this latest tragedy commands.""
Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds visited a candlelight vigil Thursday outside Youngs Asian Spa. Reynolds told reporters he attended to let the Asian American community know that ""we have them in our hearts and our prayers and we're so sorry for the loss of life."" 
A vigil was also held Thursday outside of one of the other shooting sites, Gold Massage Spa in Atlanta.
Biden ordered flags at the White House and other federal grounds to be flown at half-staff Thursday to honor the shooting victims. The US Embassy in Seoul also lowered flags, Charg└ d'Affaires ad interim Rob Rapson said on Twitter.
""Our hearts go out to the loved ones of those we lost and our nation mourns with you,"" he said.
Victim's husband says he heard gunfire from a separate room
The names of all eight people slain have been released.
Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, of Acworth; Paul Andre Michels, 54, of Atlanta; Xiaojie Tan, 49, of Kennesaw; and Daoyou Feng, 44, were fatally shot at Youngs Asian Massage in Cherokee County.
Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, of Acworth, was also shot but survived.
Yaun's husband, Mario Gonzalez, told the Mundo Hispanico newspaper that he and his wife were at the spa to get massages, and she was in a separate room when the shooting started.
""About an hour in ... I heard the shots. I didn't see anything, only I started to think it was in the room where my wife was,"" he told the newspaper.
""(The shooter) took the most valuable thing I had in my life,"" Gonzalez said. ""He left me with only pain.""
Gonzalez said he was detained by authorities following the shooting and didn't know his wife was killed until later. 
When law enforcement arrived, he was put in the back of a vehicle, Gonzalez told the Spanish-language newspaper. ""They had me in a patrol car the whole time until the investigation led them to the suspect and to what happened.""
""When they found out I was the husband, they told me she was dead. I wanted to know before,"" Gonzalez said. 
It is not clear how long he was detained by authorities. Attempts to reach Gonzalez have been unsuccessful. CNN has reached out to the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office for comment but has not yet heard back. 
Victim's son mourns his 'strongest influence' 
About 30 miles away and within an hour of the first shooting, four Asian women were killed in Atlanta -- three at the Gold Massage Spa, and one at the Aroma Therapy Spa across the street, authorities said.
The four Atlanta victims were: Soon Chung Park, 74; Hyun Jung Grant, 51; Suncha Kim, 69; and Yong Ae Yue, 63, according to the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office.
Of those four, three died of gunshot wounds to the head, and one died of a gunshot wound to the chest, the medical examiner's office said.
Grant was a ""single mother who dedicated her whole life to providing for my brother and I,"" her son Randy Park wrote on a GoFundMe page.
""She was one of my best friends and the strongest influence on who we are today,"" Park wrote.
The GoFundMe page, set up for Grant's two sons, had raised more than $1.5 million from more than 40,000 donors as of Friday evening. GoFundMe told CNN the page is verified; Park did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.
The page says the donated money will pay for food, rent and other monthly bills. It says the brothers now only have each other in the US, with every other relative in South Korea.
""Losing her has put a new lens on my eyes on the amount of hate that exists in our world,"" Park wrote.

"China opens its borders to foreigners who take Chinese shots, as geopolitical vaccine silos emerge",20/3/2021,,"China is making it easier for foreigners to enter the country. But there's one condition: they need to have received a China-made Covid-19 vaccine.   At least 23 Chinese embassies around the world issued new visa policies over the past week with this condition, including in the United States and United Kingdom -- both places where Chinese vaccines aren't available.  China's foreign ministry says the move is about kick-starting international travel in an ""orderly fashion,"" and vaccinated travelers will still face state-run quarantine on arrival. But experts have raised concerns over China's decision to prioritize domestic vaccines over those approved by the World Health Organization, and with a higher efficacy rate.   They say it risks pressuring countries to approve Chinese vaccines and sets a dangerous precedent which, if adopted by other nations, could leave the world in vaccine-based silos.  It also raises practical issues -- what options do people have if they live in countries which haven't approved China-made vaccines? ""It's very much at the sharp end of vaccine diplomacy,"" said Nicholas Thomas, an associate professor in health security at the City University of Hong Kong. ""(It's) essentially saying if you want to visit us, you need to take our vaccine."" What's behind the move? The timing of China's new visa rules is notable. After the Quad -- a partnership between the US, India, Japan and Australia -- met last week, US President Joe Biden announced they would together finance, manufacture and distribute at least 1 billion vaccines for the Indo-Pacific by the end of 2022. Those vaccines would be developed in the US and manufactured in India, which has been engaging in its own vaccine diplomacy around the region. Some saw that as a direct counter to China's own vaccine diplomacy efforts, which were recently criticized by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, saying Chinese vaccines comes with ""strings attached.""  China has been one of a number of countries at the forefront of vaccine development and, as of March 15, China had exported vaccines to 28 countries, according to the Chinese Mission to the UN. Mass public vaccination programs with Chinese vaccines are underway in Indonesia and Turkey. In China alone, 65 million people have been vaccinated with the country's five approved domestically produced vaccines. But none of China's vaccines have yet been approved by the WHO or have released full Phase 3 trial data, leading to a lack of clarity over how effective the vaccines really are. The available data suggests China's vaccines may actually be less effective than other vaccines -- Sinovac, for example, had an efficacy rate of 50.38% in late-stage trials in Brazil, lower than the 78% announced in China, and lower than the efficacy rate of other vaccines such as Pfizer, which has reported a 95% efficacy rate.  That means China can't claim its preference for homegrown vaccines is due to them being superior to other vaccines. Instead, Thomas sees China's new visa rules as a ""power move,"" which will pressure people to take one of China's vaccines.  Sarah Chan, a reader in bioethics at the University of Edinburgh's College of Medicine, says if someone's livelihood depends on traveling to China for work, that could push them to take the vaccines, despite their lack of data. Scott Rosenstein, director of the global health programme at Eurasia Group, said it could also pressure countries to authorize the Chinese vaccines.  Some people may have health conditions that mean they are unable to take certain shots. ""It is simply not justified to make so much of what we do depend on whether or not we have had a vaccine, let alone whether we have had one particular version of the vaccine,"" Chan said.   Despite China's new visa rules placing an incentive on travelers to take the Chinese vaccines, Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rejected the idea of ""vaccine nationalism."" ""Regardless of where a vaccine is made, it is a good vaccine so long as it is safe and effective,"" he said in a press conference Monday. ""China stands ready to advance mutual recognition of vaccination with other countries."" What are the longer term effects? China's move comes as countries around the world tackle the broader question of whether to roll out so-called ""immunity passports"" to open up international travel to people who have antibodies to coronavirus -- either because they have recovered from it or through a vaccine.  But that leads to more questions -- if an immunity passport gives special rights to people who have been vaccinated, which vaccines should be counted?  One option is to follow the WHO authorization. Currently, only four vaccines, including two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, have been given emergency use listing by the WHO -- and none are China-made.  Another option is to let the 194 member states of the World Health Organization vote -- those vaccines approved and recognized by the most countries would set the standard, according to Thomas.  But a uniform vaccine passport for the world is a long way off. For now, countries are likely to simply recognize the vaccines they have approved for use -- and already there's signs of that leading to silos. The European Commission this week announced a Digital Green Certificate with a QR code to show whether a person has been vaccinated. But member states will only waive free movement restrictions for people vaccinated with shots that have received EU marketing authorization -- those who've had the Chinese shots may be left in the cold.  ""It is this brewing tit-for-tat challenge that I think will be interesting to watch,"" Rosenstein said. ""It will create a certain amount of tension and will escalate this pre-existing vaccine diplomacy tension."" Rosenstein said people might even opt to take multiple vaccines so they can travel to other regions -- a step unlikely to have negative health effects, but which could stress vaccine supply.  What's the best way forward? Even aside from the problems of deciding which vaccines are accepted, there are other issues with immunity passports -- we don't know how long immunity to Covid-19 lasts, either from recovering from the virus or from vaccines. There are also ethical issues -- while the WHO is working on a ""smart digital certificate"" that would include vaccination information, it is discouraging the use of vaccine passports for travel. ""There is a global shortage of vaccines,"" WHO Europe director Hans Kluge said Thursday. ""So this would increase the inequities.""  Chan sees a raft of problems with immunity passports, especially high-tech digital ones that come with data privacy concerns. She also points out that once everyone has had a chance to be vaccinated, vaccine passports could become obsolete quickly -- meaning money could be spent better elsewhere. A better approach would be making sure vaccines are as widely available as possible, she said. Then, when much of the world's population has been vaccinated, immigration authorities can use simpler approaches, like asking the public to self-report if they've had any vaccine. If some people lied, the risk to the population overall would still be small, as most people had been vaccinated, she added. Thomas also hopes for a best-case scenario where countries don't follow China's lead -- instead, they treat all vaccinated people the same, regardless of the vaccine, so long as the vaccine has data to support its efficacy. He hopes countries can stop treating the vaccine rollout as a race, and instead treat it as a global health issue.  ""The viruses don't care about borders, they don't care about nationalities or races or religions or ideologies or ethnicities or anything like that, they just want to replicate and mutate,"" he said.  ""And I think unless we do take a truly global approach to vaccines, and recognize that we have to simply do the best on a global level, then we're going to be looking at latent pools of Covid cropping up again in the future and possibly like the second wave of the Spanish influenza, mutating in such a way that makes it worse than before.""",news,
Extraordinary diplomatic clash signals tough times ahead for the US and China,20/3/2021,"The tense and unusual diplomatic clash Thursday between senior US and Chinese officials signals a tough road ahead as the world's two largest economies maneuver a relationship that is not going to improve easily or quickly, analysts said, and instead, may only get harder to navigate.
The typically dull prelude to diplomatic meetings spiraled quickly out of control in part because of mismatched expectations and because both sides delivered speeches meant just as much for their domestic audiences as for their counterparts. 
The Biden administration wants to maintain a tough line on China, particularly on areas of sensitivity for Beijing, such as human rights, and is not likely to ease up with China hawks in Congress ready to criticize any sign of weakness. Meanwhile, Beijing is intent on signaling that it is not intimidated by the US or swayed by American claims to global leadership.
""We didn't expect to see anything in terms of substantive dialogue for the meetings, so the fact that they fell apart didn't surprise us, but the fact that they fell apart so quickly and in such spectacular pattern was really notable,"" said Cailin Birch, a global economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. 
'Little scope'
The testy start could make progress difficult in areas where the two nations have an interest in cooperating, such as trade, analysts said. ""Overall,"" Birch concluded, Thursday's meeting demonstrates that ""there is little scope for an improvement in US-China relations in the near term.""
Blinken and Sullivan were in Anchorage to meet with China's foreign policy chief Yang Jiechi and State Councilor Wang Yi for two sessions on Thursday and a third on Friday. The event went awry right almost immediately when the two sides gathered for what is usually a ceremonial exchange of remarks before the press. 
After Blinken's description of Washington's ""deep concerns"" about some of Beijing's human rights record and aggressive behavior overseas, Chinese officials ignored protocol to blast the US, the state of its democracy, and its record on racial justice. Blinken then countered with his own unscripted rebuttal. Both sides insisted cameras stay in the room to capture their remarks.
The two US officials raised a slew of issues, ranging from ongoing repression in Xinjiang that Blinken has called genocide to China's cyber attacks. But the speeches were likely meant as much for audiences at home as for each other. 
""A lot of it was probably theater for domestic audiences, there's definitely some of that for the US and some of that for China,"" Birch said.
In a long set of remarks, Yang made clear that China feels the US has no right to meddle in its ""internal"" affairs, claim a right to global leadership, or even to promote its vision for democracy and human rights, given the domestic controversy about the 2020 election and the injustices laid bare by US racial justice protests. ""The US does not have the qualification to say it can speak from a position of strength,"" foreign policy chief Yang Jiechi scoffed.
Pointing to the ""intensity"" and ""vociferousness"" of Yang's rebuttal, Birch said, ""it was probably meant to show China is not intimidated and it was a show of disrespect too -- China is making clear that it's not going to follow the rules.""  
A senior Republican aide suggested that Blinken and Sullivan were probably aware that lawmakers were watching too. 
""They cannot afford to give them an inch right now,"" this aide said of the Biden administration's approach to China. ""We all know China is now the biggest issue geopolitically, especially for the Hill on foreign policy. They could not give an inch. They had to be strong, they had to be tough.""
It's not just Republicans the Biden administration has to be mindful of, the aide said. ""If the administration is too weak on China,"" they said, ""you may have a bipartisan group of people who may amp up and put restrictions on that effort, so there are domestic concerns they have to balance as well. The question is what happened behind closed doors.""
Staffers for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have asked the administration for readouts of the meetings on Monday. Sullivan said Friday they had been ""tough"" and that he and Blinken would return to Washington to consult with Congress and allies on the talks.
'Tough and direct'
""We expected to have tough and direct talks on a wide range of issues, and that's exactly what we had,"" Sullivan said. Blinken said that, ""on economics, on trade, on technology, we told our counterparts that we are reviewing these issues with close consultation with Congress, with our allies and partners, and we will move forward on them in a way that fully protects and advances the interests of our workers and our businesses.""
Another factor contributing to the friction was the very different expectations the two sides had about the meetings. 
""China was hoping for a reset and at least in theory was hoping to have one introductory, low-key meeting to set the tone,"" Birch said. ""Obviously, with Blinken's comments, that possibility went out the window. The US team was coming in planning to discuss really sensitive issues for China -- its human rights record and territorial ambitions.""
On Friday, President Joe Biden signaled that Blinken had his full backing, telling reporters he was ""very proud"" of the top US diplomat after his verbal showdown with the Chinese officials. Stephen Orlins, president of the National Committee on United States-China Relations, said that Biden's message of ""unequivocal support"" proves that, ""this administration is not like the previous administration and speaks with one voice on China ... They are all reading from the same playbook.""
By emphasizing the Biden administration's concerns about human rights and the threat China poses to smaller countries and US allies, Blinken and Sullivan also signaled that the Trump administration's transactional, trade-oriented, go-it-alone approach is over. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Blinken said he and Sullivan had two priorities for the talks.  
""First: we wanted to share with them the significant concerns we have about a number of the actions that China's taken and the behavior it's exhibiting, concerns shared by our allies and partners. And we did that,"" said Blinken. ""We also wanted to lay out very clearly our own policies, priorities, and worldview. And we did that too.""
Blinken and Sullivan emphasized that they'll continue to work with China on areas of mutual interest, including Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan, but climate ""is maybe the only real possibility for near term, substantial progress,"" Birch said. ""It's the only real area where we see the two countries being aligned and where their partnership would spin well for both governments, whereas even a sign of cooperation on trade would be hard to sell at home, especially in the US.""
","Chinese officials dismissed Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan as ""condescending."" An unnamed US official said the Chinese were ""grandstanding."" And with that, any chance the US and China might shift course after four turbulent years of the Trump administration quickly faded. The tense and unusual diplomatic clash Thursday between senior US and Chinese officials signals a tough road ahead as the world's two largest economies maneuver a relationship that is not going to improve easily or quickly, analysts said, and instead, may only get harder to navigate.

"Speaking out against hate crimes, Biden tries to restore moral clarity to the presidency",20/3/2021,"Condemning the permissive culture of scapegoating and vitriol that Trump helped create -- without mentioning him by name -- Biden and Harris called attention to the alarming rise in racist incidents during their visit to Atlanta, promising to focus their energy on halting those kinds of verbal and physical attacks days after the shocking murders of eight people at Atlanta area spas -- six of whom were Asian women.
in their solemn speeches at Emory University, Biden and Harris were reclaiming one of the central roles of recent American presidents, which is not only to convey empathy after a tragic incident like the shootings Tuesday, but also to provide moral clarity on matters of race, said CNN presidential historian Tim Naftali. That responsibility was one that Trump repeatedly shirked -- from his moral equivalency about the protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, to the way he turned a blind eye to rise the in anti-Asian attacks last year. 
""A president is uniquely positioned to help cut through the prejudice and dispel some of the fears,"" while reminding Americans of the ""better angels"" of their natures, Naftali said. ""Calling out racism isn't a partisan act. And I believe those who see it as a partisan act, don't understand the nature of racism in America.""
After what Biden described as a ""heart-wrenching"" listening session with lawmakers and leaders of the Asian American Pacific Islander community, Harris -- the first woman of South Asian descent to be vice president -- pointedly alluded to Trump when she noted that violence has increased at the same time that ""we've had people in positions of incredible power scapegoating Asian Americans"" and ""spreading this kind of hate.""
She also used her speech to acknowledge the dark history of racism in America toward people of Asian descent -- from the discrimination against Chinese workers who built the transcontinental railroad to the internment of more than 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II. Both Biden and Harris also sought to illuminate the intimidation, harassment and fear that many Asian Americans have experienced during the pandemic.
Referring to Tuesday's murders in Atlanta, Biden said that ""whatever the motivation"" of the killer, the fact remains that ""too many Asian Americans have been walking up and down the streets and worrying; waking up each morning the past year feeling their safety and the safety of their loved ones are at stake.""
""They've been attacked, blamed, scapegoated and harassed,"" Biden said. ""They've been verbally assaulted, physically assaulted, killed. Documented incidents of hate against Asian Americans have seen a skyrocketing spike over the last year,"" he added, noting that many incidents never get reported.
""We're learning again what we've always known: words have consequences,"" Biden said, alluding to the slurs by Trump and others over the past year. ""It's the coronavirus. Full stop. ... Hate and violence often hide in plain sight. It's often met with silence. ... But that has to change, because our silence is complicity. We cannot be complicit. We have to speak out, we have to act.""
Many members of the AAPI community wanted Biden and Harris to more forcefully steer law enforcement officials toward investigating the spa shootings as a hate crime, even though Biden made it a practice during his campaign to say that he would avoid directing law enforcement or Department of Justice officials on how to conduct their investigations. 
Harris, a former prosecutor and California attorney general, seemed to edge closest to making her own opinion clear by stating there were incontrovertible facts about the incidents.  
""Six out of the eight people killed on Tuesday night were of Asian descent. Seven were women,"" Harris said. ""The shootings took place in businesses owned by Asian Americans. The shootings took place as violent hate crimes and discrimination against Asian Americans has risen dramatically over the last year, and more.""
She noted that there have been some 3,800 such incidents reported over the past year -- two of every three by women, ""everything from physical assaults to verbal accusations.""
""It's all harmful, and sadly it's not new. Racism is real in America and it has always been,"" said Harris. ""Xenophobia is real in America, and always has been. Sexism too.""
Urging passage of anti-hate crime legislation
The way in which Biden and Harris are shining a light on racism and violence toward Asian Americans marks a course correction from Trump, but also a return to the more traditional role that presidents have played as a moral authority for the country ever since former President John F. Kennedy set a marker by declaring that civil rights was a moral issue for the presidency, Naftali said.
""President Trump was an aberration among modern presidents,"" said Naftali, who teaches at New York University. ""From Kennedy on, the moral defense of civil rights has been part of the responsibilities of heads of state of this country. It doesn't mean that they've all taken it up with purpose and passion. But many of them have.""
Naftali cited the example of former President George W. Bush visiting a mosque six days after the terrorist attacks of September 11 -- at a time when many Muslims were being villainized. During that visit, Bush called on Americans to respect Islam as a religion of peace and to respect Muslims as valuable contributors to society who should be treated with respect.
Former President Barack Obama delivered a powerful eulogy for the Rev. Clementa Pinckney in Charleston in 2015 -- suggesting that the racially-motivated killings of Pinckney and eight other people by a White gunman during bible study at Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church could lead Americans to reexamine their biases and prejudices and embrace their common humanity with their neighbors.
The growing political power of Asian Americans 
Standing with members of the Asian American community -- whose voters have been increasingly influential in recent presidential and congressional elections -- will be not just a moral imperative, but a political one.
A Pew Research Center report last year showed that Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial or ethnic group within the electorate, comprising nearly 5% of the nation's eligible voters last year. Party affiliation varies by origin group, but both Democrats and Republicans have stepped up their outreach to different Asian American Pacific Islander communities in recent years in recognition of their growing influence.
Still, in this deeply polarized nation where Trump's politics of demonization cast a long shadow, it is not yet clear how Congress will react to Biden's call for passing the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act as an immediate step after the Atlanta spa shootings.
Some Republicans were hesitant to comment on the Atlanta spa shootings and whether they were racially motivated. And the bill could run into political headwinds in Congress where some Republicans have defended Trump's use of the term ""China virus.""  
Most House Republicans voted against a resolution introduced by Democratic Rep. Grace Meng of New York denouncing anti-Asian sentiment in the midst of the pandemic during the last session of Congress. The resolution said that ""the use of anti-Asian terminology and rhetoric related to COVID-19, such as the 'Chinese Virus', 'Wuhan Virus', and 'Kung-flu' have perpetuated anti-Asian stigma."" Fourteen Republicans joined Democrats to pass the resolution 243-164.
This week, during a congressional hearing that was supposed to be about discrimination against Asian Americans, Texas Rep. Chip Roy, a Republican, infuriated Democratic lawmakers by rambling about lynchings, his dislike of the Chinese Communist Party and what he viewed as the policing of free speech.
""Your president and your party and your colleagues can talk about issues with any other country that you want, but you don't have to do it by putting a bullseye on the back of Asian Americans across this country, on our grandparents, on our kids,"" Meng said in an impassioned response to Roy. ""This hearing was to address the hurt and pain of our community and to find solutions, and we will not let you take our voice from us."" 
When House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was asked Thursday whether he regretted using the term ""China virus,"" he replied, ""I don't know,"" and said people should wait to see ""why the shooter did what he did."" At the same time, the California Republican said he unequivocally condemned violence and discrimination against Asian Americans. 
The Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act, which would provide more funds to the Justice Department to fight the kinds of hate crimes that have become all too common during the pandemic, would help state and local governments approve hate crimes reporting and enhance education within Asian American communities about how to report hate crimes.
Biden called for urgency from members of Congress on Friday to pass both the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act and the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which he initially authored more than 25 years ago and which the House voted to reauthorize this week but will likely face a tougher path in the Senate. 
But he acknowledged there's a limit to what legislation can do.
""For all the good laws can do, we have to change our hearts,"" Biden said in Atlanta. ""Hate can have no safe harbor in America. It must stop. It's on all of us, all of us together to make it stop.""

My wish for my Asian American daughter: A world that sees her in all her humanity,20/3/2021,"To some, it might seem to be a knee-jerk assessment. For me, given the way tension, suspicion and hate have unfolded for Asian Americans like me and those of Asian descent across the globe during this pandemic, it was instinct. 
As information about the spa shooting trickled out, it was clear my gut was right. Six of the eight victims were women of Asian descent. The Atlanta police have said that it's too early in the investigation to determine that the shootings were a hate crime, but given the rise in anti-Asian American violence, it's difficult not to draw a correlation.
This horrific violence is not the first nor sadly the last time I will have this foreboding gut reaction. Certainly not as the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic continue to rip through American life. While America has collectively suffered trauma from the coronavirus and can largely identify with the fear of contracting this invisible and deadly virus, Asian Americans have also shouldered a different worry as we continue to be scapegoated for the virus. 
Knowing that hate is on the rise, with ignorance as its partner, it has become second nature to wonder if any of my labels -- Asian American, journalist, woman, mother -- will lead to someone directing verbal abuse or physical violence  at me. 
But in the last few years, the notable rise in racial tensions across America and anti-Asian attacks, has forced me to think more about the safety of my family. 
The stabbing attack on a young Asian American family last summer in a Texas Sam's Club hit home: my young mixed race daughter looks more like me than her White father. That could've been my story. 
My dreams this past year of quarantine road tripping to meet my California-based parents in the middle of the country were put off for fear that something awful could happen to them while traveling through areas with smaller Asian American populations.
Instead, I road tripped through the American South in an RV with my husband, daughter and White mother-in-law, as the George Floyd protests erupted around the country. 
And while on the surface, it might have seemed like a safe and socially distant trip, it felt anything but during this period of racial reckoning and a pandemic. I noticed my daughter and I were often the sole minorities in RV parks surrounded by flags and signs supporting then-President Donald Trump, who routinely called Covid-19 the ""China Virus"" or ""Kung Flu.""  
I don't have to go far to face harsh truths. I've seen the dirty looks and felt visible hostility traversing Atlanta where I live. Close friends have heard me describe the challenges that can arise from being married into a family where some members still accept the tired excuses of, ""well, this person didn't mean it,"" ""that's just political jargon"" and ""these words won't have real repercussions."" 
Many people can afford to excuse the ""crazy uncle"" who says racist things, but in doing so, they allow unacceptable rhetoric that has real life harmful implications for those like myself, who cannot shed their skin -- nor would want to. 
The sting doesn't fade when those extended relatives scream ""cancel culture"" over the publisher's decision to stop distributing a few Dr. Seuss books with awful depictions of Asian and African Americans. To see and hear these comments is an erasure of who I am and my identity in this country, and I know I'm not alone in feeling this way. 
And I'll be the first to admit the mass media, my chosen career, still has a long way to go in resolving how Asian Americans and their respective cultures are represented or how racist acts and hate crimes are reported. While we have to report what officials say about an ongoing investigation, the media has a responsibility to ask challenging questions and not solely rely on police reporting to lead the news coverage.
We have seen officials being unreliable, not giving the entire story and using language that paints a different picture of suspects depending on their race and ethnicity. 
On Wednesday, during a press conference, a police captain said that the Atlanta shooting suspect, who is White, ""was pretty much fed up and had been kind of at the end of his rope,"" and ""Yesterday was a really bad day for him, and this is what he did.""
It was dismissive and dehumanized the community victimized by this awful act. 
For far too long, the media industry has skirted around honest truths, failing to provide space for those with lived experiences to contribute to the storytelling. We need to see and hear  more of the stories that represent the deep diversity of  life in the AAPI community -- only in doing so will we influence how our society views Asian Americans. 
Anti-Asian sentiments and attacks  are far from new in the US; incidents like the Page Act of 1875, Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII  are parts of an evergrowing undercurrent running through America's ocean of history.  The erasure of this history must end. Now, there has been a new collective effort to push back against the hate instead of quietly accepting the harmful ""model minority"" myth that has made us sweep microaggressions, discrimination and violence under the rug. 
As the mom of a daughter who will inevitably have to navigate through this world as a woman of Asian heritage, I am not going to stop fighting to use the voice I have as a journalist to make sure this world is ready to see her and treat her and all other Asian Americans with respect and dignity.
My hope is that she will one day live in a world that demands nothing less -- and that she never has to experience the same gut instinct worry I had after hearing of the shootings. 
","On Tuesday night, a good friend and fellow journalist texted me as reports were coming out of a string of spa shootings across the metro Atlanta area. My first thought was, I really hope this isn't targeting Asian-run spas. To some, it might seem to be a knee-jerk assessment. For me, given the way tension, suspicion and hate have unfolded for Asian Americans like me and those of Asian descent across the globe during this pandemic, it was instinct.  As information about the spa shooting trickled out, it was clear my gut was right. Six of the eight victims were women of Asian descent.

Asian American communities on edge after deadly shootings,20/3/2021,,"President Biden provided Americans a sobering look at the racist behavior countless Asian Americans have had to contend with since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Biden's remarks were made in Atlanta this afternoon just days after the deadly shootings at three Atlanta-area spas where six of the eight people killed were Asian women. ""Their families are left with?broken hearts and unanswered?questions and the investigation?is ongoing,"" Biden said. ""Whatever the motivation we know?this, too many Asian Americans?have been walking up and down?the streets and worrying, waking?up each morning the past year?feeling their safety and the?safety of their loved ones are?at stake. They've been attacked, blamed,?scapegoated, harassed.?They've been verbally assaulted,?physically assaulted, killed."" Biden added: ""Documented incidents of hate?against Asian Americans have?seen a skyrocketing spike over?the last year, let alone the?ones that happened and never get?reported.?It's been a year of living in?fear for their lives just to?walk down the street. .... With all the good that laws can?do, we have to change our?hearts.?Hate can have no safe harbor in?America.?It must stop.?It's on all of us, all of us?together to make it stop."" Watch here: Vice President Kamala Harris made a speech this afternoon acknowledging the United States' racist past in the aftermath of the shootings that claimed eight lives earlier this week around the Atlanta area. ""The shootings took place as?violent hate crimes and?discrimination against Asian?Americans has risen dramatically?over the last year and more,"" Harris said. ""Racism is real in America and it?has always been; xenophobia is?real in America and always has?been; sexism, too."" Harris added: ""For the last year we've had?people in positions of?incredible power scapegoating?Asian Americans, people with the?biggest pulpits spreading this?kind of hate.?Ultimately this is about who we?are as a nation. This is about how we treat?people with dignity and respect.?Everyone has the right to go to?work, to go to school, to walk?down the street and be safe and?also the right to be recognized?as an American, not as the?other, not as them, but as us."" Vice President Kamala Harris?vowed Friday to ""always speak out against violence"" following a meeting with Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) leaders in Georgia. The vice president shared her message on Twitter after meeting with leaders following shootings at three Atlanta-area spas, which killed eight people ！ including six Asian women.? ＾We want Asian Americans in Georgia and across our nation to know: We won't be silent. We won't standby. We will always speak out against violence,"" she said. Read her full tweet: Greg Hynson remembers his friend, Atlanta-area spa shooting victim?Xiaojie Tan, who he knew as Emily, as someone that made you feel like family. He said he would often stop by her Cherokee County business, Young¨s Asian Massage, to say ""Hello,"" just like he did this past weekend.?It was the last time Hynson said he saw Tan, who was busy at the time.?? ""I'll come back later,"" he remembered telling her when he saw her.?? ""I didn't get a chance to come back later,"" he said.?? This past October, during his birthday, he remembered getting a text from Tan, who wrote, ""Hey, what are you doing?""? She then invited him over to the business, where flowers and a cake, with his name, was waiting for him.?? That's just emblematic of the type of person Tan was, Hynson said ！?loving and unselfish.?? ""Hey, we're family,"" he remembered they would tell each other often.?""I'll watch your back, you watch mine.""? The two met through mutual friends more than five years ago.?? Tan, he said, was a diligent, hardworking businesswoman.?? ""Emily¨s employees, they were always sweet and nice people,"" he said.?""Very similar to her personality.""

We asked Asian Americans about their experiences with hate. The responses were heartbreaking,19/3/2021,"These are some examples of hostility that Asian Americans have faced in the last year. While this hatred directed at the Asian community is anything but new, animosity toward the group has grown in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Last March, then-President Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as ""the Chinese virus"" -- subsequently, many Asian Americans said they were blamed for bringing Covid-19 to the US. Asian American businesses that were already devastated by the hardship of the pandemic took a second financial hit due to the discrimination they experienced.
There were 3,795 firsthand complaints of racism and discrimination against Asian Americans from March 19, 2020, through the end of February 2021, according to the coalition Stop AAPI Hate. Earlier this week, eight people -- six of whom were Asian women -- were killed in the Atlanta shootings at three spas. The incident shook up many in the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community.
While the past year has magnified the hate, it's also inspiring some Asian Americans to stop being silent and speak out about their experiences.?CNN asked Asian Americans to share their stories with us.?We received more than 300 responses.
CNN is only using first names for their safety and to help prevent them from facing retribution in their communities.
A man tried to rip off her mask
At the start of the pandemic, Jae said a man got into her face and tried to rip her mask off in the middle of a grocery store.
""I was confronted by a man who was very upset with me being there, telling me that I brought the China virus in this community and I should get out,"" the 43-year-old cardiologist from Oregon said. ""He tried to rip the mask off my face. It was very scary and I just had to leave.""
He called her a b*tch -- but what was worse, Jae said, was that he also called her a racial slur for Chinese people.
""I'm not even Chinese. I'm Korean, for God's sake, you know? My first reaction is to try to make him understand that this is absolutely false,"" she said. ""My latter thought was this is getting dangerous. I think ... I may get physically hurt.""
Shaken, Jae went home and told her husband about what happened that day in spring 2020. She never reported the incident and she stopped going to the store at night -- she tried not to go out at night at all, except when she was needed at the hospital, she said.
In the past year, Jae started to notice that now she avoids crowds too, especially in the wake of the attacks and violence on Asian Americans.
Jae said she was hurt and scared by what happened, especially since she's part of this community. Patients stop her in the streets and people recognize her in her city, which is less than 100,000 people, she said. 
Jae said she hopes people start seeing Asian Americans as part of the communities where they live. 
""I think the violence happens because you see these people as the other people, other people who cause harm, other people who done me wrong, other people who brought this virus,"" she said. ""These are all misinformation where people are considered to be others.""
She wishes she would have said something earlier to stand up for other minority groups facing racism.
""I wish I spoke up sooner for all violence against minorities, like when the Black Lives Matter movement happened, when there were people, other minorities who were facing just crushing racism and violence,"" she said.
A woman told him to go back to his country
Seeing the faces of the victims in the Atlanta-area spa shootings made Ian feel horrible, he said. He didn't know any of the of the victims, six of whom were Asian women, but they felt familiar.
""It's very difficult to describe this feeling of just like grieving, even if it's people you never knew or never heard of or never had contact with,"" the 24-year-old writer said. ""Psychologically, it does a lot to your head to just hear about people being shot and killed because of how they look, because they look like my grandma, because they look like my mom.""
The New York resident immigrated to America from Mexico when he was 7. Born to a Chinese mother and a Mexican-Japanese father, Ian said he's used to being called racial slurs.
Dealing with ignorance and racism isn't new for him. But in the past year, he said he thinks people who are saying anti-Asian things feel more empowered.
""I think this has always existed,"" he said. ""But this past year, I do feel like people have been more empowered to be more public about it ... to be very publicly anti-Asian and to get the support that they feel that they want behind them.""
Ian was leaving a store with a friend when a woman started following them and yelling in April 2020. A sinking feeling made his stomach hurt. He sensed she was directing her anger at him, he said.
""As someone who is very attuned to getting called racial slurs ... you just feel it when someone's talking to you in that tone of voice,"" he said. ""I tuned in and I heard her saying, 'Oh, you like disgusting, dog-eating ch***, go back to China, you're so dirty.'""
He asked his friend if she heard what the woman said. His friend didn't realize what had just happened, which Ian said made him feel alone.
""As someone who has experienced stuff like that in the past, you (are) just constantly on alert and you catch things like that. Whereas my friend who is White, she didn't really know what was happening,"" he said. ""I felt something that was traumatic happening, which I wasn't able to process it at all.""
Ian said he feels targeted just for the way he looks.
""There's no desire to see me as a person. There's no desire to get to know me,"" he said. ""It's purely, 'I've made up my mind about who you are and I hate you for it.' And to me, that's where racism is.""
Customers threw their masks at her
Food truck co-owner and chef Brittany closed her business twice during the pandemic. The first time was because business was slow -- the second time was because she feared for her safety.
Brittany was working alone on her Japanese food truck in July 2020 when two customers started slinging slurs and even throwing things at the truck, she said. 
""I had a couple of customers come up and basically just take the masks off their face, throw them at the window,"" she said. ""They were telling me, 'Go back to China. Why did you why did you come here? Stop eating bats.'""
The 32-year-old of Japanese and Mexican descent, feared for her safety. She said the customers were loud, swearing and yelling slurs at her and she was in a dark location in the evening -- alone.
""(I) just to have to be extra concerned now for if something was going to happen, if they were going to try and break in and hurt me or take the money,"" she said.
Brittany closed up shop from July to September of 2020, shaken by the incident. Her business took a huge hit financially, but she did it for peace of mind, she said. She lives in an open carry city, and said she worries about armed harassers.
""I actually keep a gun on the truck now under the register area or wherever on me just in case ... because I have no idea what's going to happen,"" she said.
Brittany, who opened her food truck in July 2019, said she never heard any racist comments directed toward her. 
But, xenophobic and racist comments ""ramped up last year with the Covid stuff,"" she said.
Business has gotten better and the customers have too, occasionally cracking jokes about if they serve bats and asking her not to cough on the food, she said.
A car blocked her from leaving the parking lot
Ever since Lucy moved to the United States from her native Thailand in the 1960s, she vowed to be active and involved as a citizen.
The outspoken 65-year-old was in the Nevada caucus. She also attends political rallies, and is active in her community.
But when she's the target of racist comments, she doesn't feel like it's safe to stand up to her aggressors.
Lucy was using her walking cart to get to her car when someone in a large SUV almost ran her over, she said. As she loaded her groceries in the car, she noticed the vehicle was blocking her into her handicapped spot.
""I got out and he's staring at me and I said, 'If you can just move back, I could leave,'"" she said. ""He said, 'Well, do you think I'm stupid?'""
The man called her names and screamed at her. ""'You effing ch***.' You know, the usual Asian names that they always call us,"" she said.
Some of the people in the parking lot got out of their cars and came to her defense. A few people came and stood next to her car with her and a Black man leaned on his trunk and called the police, she said.
Eventually, the man quickly backed up and Lucy exited the parking lot.
""I just went home and just vented to my kids, so didn't say anything, didn't call the police, nothing,"" she said. ""That's the problem is that we go home and ... we don't ever say anything.""
Even though the pandemic has been hard, and she's experienced incidents like this one, Lucy said wearing a mask has an unintended benefit.
""Wearing a mask actually hides a lot of my Asian features and people just don't know what I am these days,"" she said. ""It's nice to be anonymous once in a while.""
Don't let that fool you, though. Lucy is proud of her heritage -- she is just tired of getting hurt and blamed for the virus.
""I want everybody to know we are not responsible for the virus, we in America are not responsible,"" she said. ""I really want everyone to be involved. Don't keep quiet and get vaccinated.""
She encourages other Asian Americans to speak up and say what they mean.
""We're all proud to be Asian Americans,"" she said. ""We're peaceful people, we're forgiving, but we hurt, too.""
","A cardiologist at a grocery store almost had her mask ripped off. A young man was verbally accosted, and his White friend didn't notice. A retired woman was called a racial slur and blocked from exiting a parking lot. These are some examples of hostility that Asian Americans have faced in the last year. While this hatred directed at the Asian community is anything but new, animosity toward the group has grown in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.  Last March, then-President Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as ""the Chinese virus"" -- subsequently, many Asian Americans said they were blamed for bringing Covid-19 to the US. Asian American businesses that were already devastated by the hardship of the pandemic took a second financial hit due to the discrimination they experienced. There were 3,795 firsthand complaints of racism and discrimination against Asian Americans from March 19, 2020, through the end of February 2021, according to the coalition Stop AAPI Hate. Earlier this week, eight people -- six of whom were Asian women -- were killed in the Atlanta shootings at three spas. The incident shook up many in the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. While the past year has magnified the hate, it's also inspiring some Asian Americans to stop being silent and speak out about their experiences.?CNN asked Asian Americans to share their stories with us.?We received more than 300 responses. CNN is only using first names for their safety and to help prevent them from facing retribution in their communities. A man tried to rip off her mask At the start of the pandemic, Jae said a man got into her face and tried to rip her mask off in the middle of a grocery store. ""I was confronted by a man who was very upset with me being there, telling me that I brought the China virus in this community and I should get out,"" the 43-year-old cardiologist from Oregon said. ""He tried to rip the mask off my face. It was very scary and I just had to leave."" He called her a b*tch -- but what was worse, Jae said, was that he also called her a racial slur for Chinese people. ""I'm not even Chinese. I'm Korean, for God's sake, you know? My first reaction is to try to make him understand that this is absolutely false,"" she said. ""My latter thought was this is getting dangerous. I think ... I may get physically hurt."" Shaken, Jae went home and told her husband about what happened that day in spring 2020. She never reported the incident and she stopped going to the store at night -- she tried not to go out at night at all, except when she was needed at the hospital, she said. In the past year, Jae started to notice that now she avoids crowds too, especially in the wake of the attacks and violence on Asian Americans. Jae said she was hurt and scared by what happened, especially since she's part of this community. Patients stop her in the streets and people recognize her in her city, which is less than 100,000 people, she said.  Jae said she hopes people start seeing Asian Americans as part of the communities where they live.  ""I think the violence happens because you see these people as the other people, other people who cause harm, other people who done me wrong, other people who brought this virus,"" she said. ""These are all misinformation where people are considered to be others."" She wishes she would have said something earlier to stand up for other minority groups facing racism. ""I wish I spoke up sooner for all violence against minorities, like when the Black Lives Matter movement happened, when there were people, other minorities who were facing just crushing racism and violence,"" she said. A woman told him to go back to his country Seeing the faces of the victims in the Atlanta-area spa shootings made Ian feel horrible, he said. He didn't know any of the of the victims, six of whom were Asian women, but they felt familiar. ""It's very difficult to describe this feeling of just like grieving, even if it's people you never knew or never heard of or never had contact with,"" the 24-year-old writer said. ""Psychologically, it does a lot to your head to just hear about people being shot and killed because of how they look, because they look like my grandma, because they look like my mom."" The New York resident immigrated to America from Mexico when he was 7. Born to a Chinese mother and a Mexican-Japanese father, Ian said he's used to being called racial slurs. Dealing with ignorance and racism isn't new for him. But in the past year, he said he thinks people who are saying anti-Asian things feel more empowered. ""I think this has always existed,"" he said. ""But this past year, I do feel like people have been more empowered to be more public about it ... to be very publicly anti-Asian and to get the support that they feel that they want behind them."" Ian was leaving a store with a friend when a woman started following them and yelling in April 2020. A sinking feeling made his stomach hurt. He sensed she was directing her anger at him, he said. ""As someone who is very attuned to getting called racial slurs ... you just feel it when someone's talking to you in that tone of voice,"" he said. ""I tuned in and I heard her saying, 'Oh, you like disgusting, dog-eating ch***, go back to China, you're so dirty.'"" He asked his friend if she heard what the woman said. His friend didn't realize what had just happened, which Ian said made him feel alone. ""As someone who has experienced stuff like that in the past, you (are) just constantly on alert and you catch things like that. Whereas my friend who is White, she didn't really know what was happening,"" he said. ""I felt something that was traumatic happening, which I wasn't able to process it at all."" Ian said he feels targeted just for the way he looks. ""There's no desire to see me as a person. There's no desire to get to know me,"" he said. ""It's purely, 'I've made up my mind about who you are and I hate you for it.' And to me, that's where racism is."" Customers threw their masks at her Food truck co-owner and chef Brittany closed her business twice during the pandemic. The first time was because business was slow -- the second time was because she feared for her safety. Brittany was working alone on her Japanese food truck in July 2020 when two customers started slinging slurs and even throwing things at the truck, she said.  ""I had a couple of customers come up and basically just take the masks off their face, throw them at the window,"" she said. ""They were telling me, 'Go back to China. Why did you why did you come here? Stop eating bats.'"" The 32-year-old of Japanese and Mexican descent, feared for her safety. She said the customers were loud, swearing and yelling slurs at her and she was in a dark location in the evening -- alone. ""(I) just to have to be extra concerned now for if something was going to happen, if they were going to try and break in and hurt me or take the money,"" she said. Brittany closed up shop from July to September of 2020, shaken by the incident. Her business took a huge hit financially, but she did it for peace of mind, she said. She lives in an open carry city, and said she worries about armed harassers. ""I actually keep a gun on the truck now under the register area or wherever on me just in case ... because I have no idea what's going to happen,"" she said. Brittany, who opened her food truck in July 2019, said she never heard any racist comments directed toward her.  But, xenophobic and racist comments ""ramped up last year with the Covid stuff,"" she said. Business has gotten better and the customers have too, occasionally cracking jokes about if they serve bats and asking her not to cough on the food, she said. A car blocked her from leaving the parking lot Ever since Lucy moved to the United States from her native Thailand in the 1960s, she vowed to be active and involved as a citizen. The outspoken 65-year-old was in the Nevada caucus. She also attends political rallies, and is active in her community. But when she's the target of racist comments, she doesn't feel like it's safe to stand up to her aggressors. Lucy was using her walking cart to get to her car when someone in a large SUV almost ran her over, she said. As she loaded her groceries in the car, she noticed the vehicle was blocking her into her handicapped spot. ""I got out and he's staring at me and I said, 'If you can just move back, I could leave,'"" she said. ""He said, 'Well, do you think I'm stupid?'"" The man called her names and screamed at her. ""'You effing ch***.' You know, the usual Asian names that they always call us,"" she said. Some of the people in the parking lot got out of their cars and came to her defense. A few people came and stood next to her car with her and a Black man leaned on his trunk and called the police, she said. Eventually, the man quickly backed up and Lucy exited the parking lot. ""I just went home and just vented to my kids, so didn't say anything, didn't call the police, nothing,"" she said. ""That's the problem is that we go home and ... we don't ever say anything."" Even though the pandemic has been hard, and she's experienced incidents like this one, Lucy said wearing a mask has an unintended benefit. ""Wearing a mask actually hides a lot of my Asian features and people just don't know what I am these days,"" she said. ""It's nice to be anonymous once in a while."" Don't let that fool you, though. Lucy is proud of her heritage -- she is just tired of getting hurt and blamed for the virus. ""I want everybody to know we are not responsible for the virus, we in America are not responsible,"" she said. ""I really want everyone to be involved. Don't keep quiet and get vaccinated."" She encourages other Asian Americans to speak up and say what they mean. ""We're all proud to be Asian Americans,"" she said. ""We're peaceful people, we're forgiving, but we hurt, too.""",us,US
Blinken and Sullivan finish 'tough and direct' talks with Chinese officials,19/3/2021,"""We certainly know and knew going in that there are a number of areas where we are fundamentally at odds, including China's actions in Xinjinag, with regard to Hong Kong, Tibet, increasingly Taiwan, as well as actions it is taking in cyberspace,"" Blinken said, speaking to reporters with Sullivan after the last session of talks wrapped on Friday. ""It's no surprise that when we raised those issues clearly and directly, we got a defensive response. But we were also able to have a very candid conversation over these many hours on an expansive agenda.""
Blinken said that the US had two priorities -- laying out US and international concerns about China's behavior and conveying the Biden administration's positions. 
""We expected to have tough and direct talks on a wide range of issues, and that's exactly what we had,"" Sullivan added. ""We had the opportunity to lay out our priorities and intentions and hear from the Chinese side their priorities and intentions.""
Blinken and Sullivan sat down with China's foreign policy chief Yang Jiechi and the country's State Councilor Wang Yi for three sessions over two days that opened with a rare display of public bickering.
The extraordinary interaction unfolded in front of reporters at the start of Thursday's meetings when Chinese officials ignored protocol to rebut Blinken's description of Washington's ""deep concerns"" about some of China's actions and vociferously criticize the US, the state of its democracy and domestic racial tensions. Blinken then brought the cameras back into the room to offer his own, unscripted rebuttal from the Chinese officials. 
By evening, the Chinese had accused the US delegation of being ""condescending"" in its tone, while a US official said the representatives from Beijing seemed ""intent on grandstanding."" 
A united front
President Joe Biden said Friday he was ""proud"" of Blinken. 
""I'm very proud of the secretary of state,"" Biden said when asked by reporters on the South Lawn for his reaction to the blistering exchange between the two sides. 
The President's endorsement sends a strong signal to the Chinese that the tone struck at Thursday's meeting -- a forceful US critique of China's behavior domestically in places like Xinjiang and overseas, as well as Blinken's pushback -- has the full backing of the administration and that US officials are speaking with one voice.
Sullivan said that he and Blinken ""were clear-eyed coming in, we're clear-eyed coming out, and we will go back to Washington to take stock of where we are."" That will involve consultations with allies and partners and on the way forward, he said. 
Blinken said the pair told the Chinese that the administration's policy review continues. ""On economics, on trade, on technology, we told our counterparts that we are reviewing these issues with close consultation with Congress, with our allies and partners, and we will move forward on them in a way that fully protects and advances the interests of our workers and our businesses,"" he said.
Even as the Biden administration makes clear its areas of concern, they have also repeatedly stressed that they are ready and willing to work with China on areas of mutual interest and concern.
""Of course, on issues ranging from Iran to Afghanistan, through the normal diplomatic channels, we'll continue to work with China on the way going forward,"" Sullivan said.
On Thursday, after the public clash, a senior administration official said, ""after the pool spray, Secretary Blinken opened the discussion, and both sides immediately got down to business,"" and added that the first session of talks ""was substantive, serious, and direct.""
""We used the session, just as we had planned, to outline our interests and priorities, and we heard the same from our Chinese counterparts,"" they said.
""In fact, the discussion went well beyond the 2 hours we had allotted,"" the official said in a statement to the press.

Hurricane Season Fast Facts,19/3/2021,"Facts
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration defines a hurricane as ""an intense tropical weather system with well-defined circulation and sustained winds of 74 mph (64 knots) or higher."" In the western North Pacific Ocean, hurricanes are called typhoons while similar storms in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean are called cyclones. 
The peak of the Atlantic season is from mid-August to late October.
Hurricanes are rated according to intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. 
The 1-5 scale estimates potential property damage due to sustained wind speed. 
A Category 3 or higher is considered a major hurricane.  
A hurricane watch indicates the possibility that a region could experience hurricane conditions within 48 hours. 
A hurricane warning indicates that tropical-storm-force winds of at least 74 mph are expected within 36 hours. 
Hurricane Development
There are four stages of development: tropical disturbance, tropical depression, tropical storm and hurricane (tropical cyclone).
Tropical disturbance: Cloud columns develop into a cluster of thunderstorms. 
Tropical depression: Thunderstorms intensify, with maximum sustained winds of 38 mph or less. 
Tropical storm: Maximum sustained winds are between 39-73 mph. During this time, the storm becomes more circular in shape, with winds swirling around a calm center, known as the eye. This is when the storm is named.
Hurricane: Wind speeds reach maximum sustained winds of 74 mph.
Hurricane categories
Category 1: Minimal hurricane
Winds 74-95 mph.
Storm surge 3-5 feet. 
No significant damage to buildings. Damage primarily to unanchored homes, shrubbery and trees. 
Some damage to poorly constructed signs and coastal road flooding.
Damage to power lines and poles could result in power outages lasting a few to several days. 
Category 2: Moderate hurricane
Winds 96-110 mph. 
Storm surge 6-8 feet. 
Some damage to buildings, mainly roofs, doors and windows. Considerable damage to shrubbery and trees. Major damage to mobile homes. Extensive damage to poorly constructed signs and considerable damage to piers. 
Small crafts in unprotected anchorages may break moorings.
Power outages could last from several days to weeks. 
Category 3: Extensive hurricane
Winds 111-130 mph. 
Storm surge 9-12 feet. 
Some structural damage to small buildings. Many large trees blown down. Rampant destruction of mobile homes in storms ranked category 3 or higher. Serious coastal flooding, damaging or destroying structures along the water.  
Evacuation of low-lying residences within several blocks of the shoreline may be required. 
Electricity and water may be unavailable for several days to weeks. 
Category 4: Extreme hurricane
Winds 131-155 mph. 
Storm surge 13-18 feet. 
Extensive building damage. Shrubs, trees and signs are blown down.  Major damage to lower floors of buildings near coastline due to flooding, battering waves and floating debris. Major beach erosion. 
Power outages could last from weeks to possibly months. Areas may be uninhabitable for weeks or months. 
Category 5: Catastrophic hurricane
Winds greater than 155 mph. 
Storm surge higher than 18 feet.
Complete roof failure on many residences and industrial buildings. Widespread destruction of structures less than 15 feet above sea level within 500 yards of shore. Low-lying evacuation routes cut off by rising water 3 to 5 hours before hurricane center arrives.
Advance evacuation of residential areas on low ground within 5-10 miles of the shoreline may be required.
Power outages could last for months. Area may remain uninhabitable for months. 
Names
There are 10 regional lists of names worldwide: Atlantic, Eastern North Pacific, Central North Pacific, Western North Pacific/South China Sea, Australian Region, Nadi, Port Moresby, Jakarta, Southwest Indian Ocean and Northern Indian Ocean.
Using women's names for Atlantic storms was the practice until 1979, when male names were added to the mix.   
The World Meteorological Organization's Hurricane Committee creates lists of hurricane names that are recycled every six years. 
Names associated with storms that have caused significant death and/or damage are retired from the list. After the 2018 season, the names Florence and Michael were retired. Other names that have been removed include Camille (1969), Andrew (1992), Floyd (1999), Katrina (2005), Ike (2008), Sandy (2012), and Maria (2017). Once a name is removed, another name replaces it.

"The Covid-19 pandemic almost didn't happen, a new genetic dating study shows",19/3/2021,"Researchers working to show when and how the virus first emerged in China calculate that it probably did not infect the first human being until October 2019 at the very earliest. And their models showed something else: It almost didn't make it as a pandemic virus. 
Only bad luck and the packed conditions of the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan -- the place the pandemic appears to have begun -- gave the virus the edge it needed to explode around the globe, the researchers reported in the journal Science.
""It was a perfect storm -- we know now that it had to catch a lucky break or two to actually firmly become established,"" Michael Worobey, a professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona who worked on the study, told CNN.


""If things had been just a tiny bit different, if that first person who brought that into the Huanan market had decided to not go that day, or even was too ill to go and just stayed at home, that or other early super-spreading events might not have occurred. We may never have even known about it.""
The team employed molecular dating, using the rate of ongoing mutations to calculate how long the virus has been around. They also ran computer models to show when and how it could have spread, and how it did spread.
""Our study was designed to answer the question of how long could SARS-CoV-2 have circulated in China before it was discovered,"" said Joel Wertheim, associate professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. 

""To answer this question, we combined three important pieces of information: a detailed understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 spread in Wuhan before the lockdown, the genetic diversity of the virus in China and reports of the earliest cases of COVID-19 in China. By combining these disparate lines of evidence, we were able to put an upper limit of mid-October 2019 for when SARS-CoV-2 started circulating in Hubei province.""
The evidence strongly indicates the virus could not have been circulating before that, the researchers said. There have been reports from Italy and other European countries of evidence the virus may have infected people there before October. But Thursday's study indicates only about a dozen people were infected between October and December, Worobey said. 


""Given that, it's hard to reconcile these low levels of virus in China with claims of infections in Europe and the U.S. at the same time,"" Wertheim said in a statement. ""I am quite skeptical of claims of COVID-19 outside China at that time.""
The study indicates the virus did emerge in China's Hubei province and not elsewhere, the researchers said. 
""Our results also refute claims of large numbers of patients requiring hospitalization due to COVID-19 in Hubei province prior to December 2019,"" they wrote.
From a handful of cases ""sputtering"" along at the end of 2019, the virus exploded around the world. According to Johns Hopkins University, it's been diagnosed in 121.7 million people and it has killed nearly 2.7 million. The US has been the worst-affected country by far, with close to 30 million diagnosed cases and nearly 540,000 deaths.
The study doesn't show which animal was the source of the virus. Genetic evidence shows bats carry a closely related virus, and also suggests another, intermediate species of animal was likely infected and transmitted the virus to a human being somewhere.

This happens. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regularly tracks and reports on cases of new strains of influenza infecting people who attend county fairs and interact with pigs, for instance. But so far, none of these infections has led to an epidemic or even an outbreak. 
What's needed is an infected person and a lot of contact with other people -- such as in a densely packed seafood market. ""If the virus isn't lucky enough to find those circumstances, even a well-adapted virus can blip out of existence,"" Worobey said.
""It gives you some perspective -- these events are probably happening much more frequently than we realize. They just don't quite make it and we never hear about them,"" Worobey said.
And that could have happened with Covid-19.
In the models the team ran, the virus only takes off about 30% of the time. The rest of the time, the models show it should have gone extinct after infecting a handful of people. 

""What may have happened here was that the virus was sputtering along in a very low number of people in October, November, into December and then it got into this Huanan seafood market,"" Worobey said.
It's likely the market was not where the virus first infected people, but just the place where it got amplified.
Given how little time the virus was around, it's remarkable that it was identified so quickly, Worobey said.
""It was pretty clearly some time in December before there were was a sizable enough group of people infected that there was a chance of discovering a new virus,"" he said. By January of 2020, it had been sequenced and characterized.  
Nonetheless, it was too late -- perhaps because Covid-19 isn't quite deadly enough. The first SARS virus killed close to 10% of its victims in 2002 to 2004 before it was stopped via a concerted global effort.

""As a scientific community, we were certainly aware of the pandemic potential of a highly transmissible, moderately virulent pathogen. But our system of reporting illness is contingent on detecting spikes in hospitalizations and deaths. Clearly that wasn't enough to stop Covid-19,"" Wertheim told CNN.

""I am quite skeptical of claims of COVID-19 outside China at that time."" The study indicates the virus did emerge in China's Hubei province and not elsewhere, the researchers said.  ""Our results also refute claims of large numbers of patients requiring hospitalization due to COVID-19 in Hubei province prior to December 2019,"" they wrote. From a handful of cases ""sputtering"" along at the end of 2019, the virus exploded around the world. According to Johns Hopkins University, it's been diagnosed in 121.7 million people and it has killed nearly 2.7 million. The US has been the worst-affected country by far, with close to 30 million diagnosed cases and nearly 540,000 deaths. The study doesn't show which animal was the source of the virus. Genetic evidence shows bats carry a closely related virus, and also suggests another, intermediate species of animal was likely infected and transmitted the virus to a human being somewhere. This happens. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regularly tracks and reports on cases of new strains of influenza infecting people who attend county fairs and interact with pigs, for instance. But so far, none of these infections has led to an epidemic or even an outbreak.  What's needed is an infected person and a lot of contact with other people -- such as in a densely packed seafood market. ""If the virus isn't lucky enough to find those circumstances, even a well-adapted virus can blip out of existence,"" Worobey said. ""It gives you some perspective -- these events are probably happening much more frequently than we realize. They just don't quite make it and we never hear about them,"" Worobey said. And that could have happened with Covid-19. In the models the team ran, the virus only takes off about 30% of the time. The rest of the time, the models show it should have gone extinct after infecting a handful of people.  ""What may have happened here was that the virus was sputtering along in a very low number of people in October, November, into December and then it got into this Huanan seafood market,"" Worobey said. It's likely the market was not where the virus first infected people, but just the place where it got amplified. Given how little time the virus was around, it's remarkable that it was identified so quickly, Worobey said. ""It was pretty clearly some time in December before there were was a sizable enough group of people infected that there was a chance of discovering a new virus,"" he said. By January of 2020, it had been sequenced and characterized.   Nonetheless, it was too late -- perhaps because Covid-19 isn't quite deadly enough. The first SARS virus killed close to 10% of its victims in 2002 to 2004 before it was stopped via a concerted global effort. ""As a scientific community, we were certainly aware of the pandemic potential of a highly transmissible, moderately virulent pathogen. But our system of reporting illness is contingent on detecting spikes in hospitalizations and deaths. Clearly that wasn't enough to stop Covid-19,"" Wertheim told CNN.",health,HEALTH
Victims of the spa shootings highlight the vulnerability of working-class Asian women as more Asian Americans get attacked,19/3/2021,"""This one fact alone highlights the vulnerability, the invisibility, and the isolation of working-class Asian women in our country,"" Nguyen said at a Thursday news conference. 
""When they go missing, or when they die, the loss of their lives will not incite the same kind of rage. And they won't even be treated with the same humanity,"" she said. 
""And in this case, they've been characterized as a problem that needed to be eliminated.""
Authorities have not yet confirmed a motive for the shootings at three Atlanta-area spas, which killed eight people -- including six Asian women. A suspect is in custody. 
Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Charles Hampton Jr. said Thursday the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, frequented the two Atlanta spas and bought the gun used in the shooting the day of the incident.
President Joe Biden ordered flags to be flown at half-staff Thursday to honor the victims. Biden also plans to visit Atlanta on Friday to meet with Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, as well as Asian American and Pacific Islander leaders, according to Georgia State Rep. Bee Nguyen. 
Among the issues they will bring up is the concern that the shootings be ""taken seriously"" and seriously considered as a hate crime against Asians and not dismissed as the suspect having a ""bad day,"" Nguyen said.
Shootings part of hostility toward Asian Americans
Across the US, Asian Americans are riddled with fear as unprovoked attacks against them intensify. 
Anti-Asian hate crimes have more than doubled during the pandemic, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.
The violence has surged amid racist rhetoric during the coronavirus pandemic -- some popularized by ex-President Donald Trump. Many Asian Americans have been subjected to vitriol about the ""China virus"" or the ""kung flu"" -- even those who have never been to Asia. 
Asian American communities are on edge after Tuesday's deadly shootings.
""I feel like that just took it to a whole other extreme,"" said Hanna Kim, a teacher from Novi, Michigan.
Nguyen said as a public official, whenever anyone disagrees with her opinion or policies, the first thing they do is criticize the country her parents came from and, second, her gender. 
""I have experienced a lot of targeted misogyny, targeted xenophobia, messages of going back to your own country, even though I was born here, raised here, I've lived in Georgia almost my entire life. It is very real,"" Nguyen said. 
Actress Lucy Liu told CNN's Erin Burnett on Thursday that she believes race relations will get worse before they can get better. 
""I think culturally, we are not a people that speak out and talk about being victims and I think that's something that we learn"" from previous generations, Liu said.
Bottoms told CNN that nowadays ""there seems to be permission now to be hateful."" She's spent the past days reaching out to members of the Asian community in Atlanta ""to make sure we have all of the information we need to make sure that our communities are protected,"" adding the dialogue will continue.
""There seems to be a permission that I've not seen, at least in my lifetime,"" Bottoms said. ""It does predate Donald Trump, but he certainly has given permission and done his part to elevate the hatred."" 
Kim, a 24-year-old Korean American, said she often feels like she has a target on her back. Last year, she said a parent wanted to remove one of her students from her second-grade class because Kim was Asian.
""Are people going to say things to me?"" Kim said she often asks herself. ""Are people going to avoid me because they think that for some reason I'm going to be the one that's spreading the virus?""
Yet despite outrage over the shootings, attacks against Asian Americans continue. 
An Asian man and woman were assaulted Wednesday by the same suspect in separate attacks, San Francisco police said. Investigators are trying to determine whether bias was a motivating factor in the attack.
""While we're relieved the suspect was quickly apprehended, we're certainly not at peace as this attack still points to an escalating threat many in the Asian American community feel today,"" said Margaret Huang, president and CEO of Southern Poverty Law Center.
What we know about the victims
Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, of Acworth; Paul Andre Michels, 54, of Atlanta; Xiaojie Tan, 49, of Kennesaw; and Daoyou Feng, 44, were all fatally shot at Youngs Asian Massage in Cherokee County.
Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, of Acworth, was also shot at the spa but survived. 
Three more victims were found dead at Gold Massage Spa in Atlanta, and another victim was found dead across the street at the Aroma Therapy Spa. 
The names of those four victims have not yet been released by authorities.
Three of the victims were 52, 75 and 64 years of age, according to birth years listed in an Atlanta police incident report. 
""We need to make sure we have a true verification of their identities and that we make the proper next of kin notification,"" Hampton said Thursday. 
What we know about the suspect
Long, 21, faces eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault.
Long was on his way to Florida, possibly to take the lives of more victims, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said, citing investigators. 
The suspect told police he believed he had a sex addiction and that he saw the spas as ""a temptation ... that he wanted to eliminate,"" Cherokee County sheriff's Capt. Jay Baker said.
But Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant said it is still too early to know a motive. 
It's not clear whether any of the three businesses offered sexual services in addition to massages. But authorities have given no indication the three businesses were operating illegally.
Capt. Jay Baker on Wednesday said Long ""was pretty much fed up and had been kind of at the end of his rope. Yesterday was a really bad day for him, and this is what he did."" 
Baker is no longer the spokesperson for the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office's case investigating the spa shooting, the Sheriff's Office confirmed to CNN. 
CNN has reached out to Baker for comment.
Sheriff Frank Reynolds said in a statement Thursday he has known and worked with Baker for many years and his comments ""were not intended disrespect any of the victims, the gravity of this tragedy or express empathy or sympathy for the suspect.""
How the attacks unfolded
Shortly before 5 p.m. Tuesday, deputies were called to Youngs Asian Massage between the Georgia cities of Woodstock and Acworth after reports of a shooting, Cherokee County sheriff's officials said.
That shooting left four people -- two Asian and two White -- dead and one person injured, Baker said. 
About an hour later and 30 miles away, Atlanta police responded to the Gold Massage Spa on Piedmont Road in Atlanta. Police said they found three people dead.
While there, police received another call of shots fired across the street at the Aroma Therapy Spa, where they found one person dead, Bryant said.
The names of those four victims have not yet been released by authorities.
Investigators found surveillance video of a suspect near the Cherokee County scene and published images on social media.
Long's family saw the images, contacted authorities and helped identify him, Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said Wednesday.
""(The family members) are very distraught, and they were very helpful in this apprehension,"" Reynolds said.
'It would be appropriate' if the suspect was charged with a hate crime, mayor says
Long has claimed responsibility for the shootings at the spas, the Cherokee County sheriff's office said.
He is facing four counts of murder and a charge of aggravated assault, according to the county sheriff's office. He also has been charged with more four counts of murder, Atlanta Police Department said.
A law enforcement source told CNN that Long was recently kicked out of the house by his family due to his sexual addiction, which, the source said, included frequently spending hours watching pornography online.
Bottoms, the Atlanta mayor, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday she thinks the shootings were a hate crime. 
""It looked like a hate crime to me,"" she said. ""This was targeted at Asian spas. Six of the women who were killed were Asian so it's difficult to see it as anything but that.""
""Sex"" is a hate crime category under Georgia's new law. If Long was targeting women out of hatred for them or scapegoating them for his own problems, it could potentially be a hate crime. 
The shootings don't have to be racially motivated to constitute a hate crime in Georgia.
Cherokee County District Attorney Shannon Wallace released a statement Thursday saying ""we are acutely aware of the feelings of terror being experienced in the Asian-American community."" 
""We hear your concerns and want it to be known that these victims will receive the very best efforts of this office,"" Wallace said. ""We anticipate beginning to meet with the impacted families in the near future, and earn their trust, as we continue to develop our case against the defendant.""
Correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled Xiaojie Tan's last name based on information provided by the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office. The story also gave incorrect dates for comments made by officials. It has been corrected.

Here's what we know about the metro Atlanta spa shootings that left 8 dead,19/3/2021,"Police say video evidence led them to believe one suspect, Robert Aaron Long, was responsible for all three shootings. He was arrested on the night of March 16, about 150 miles south of Atlanta.
Here's what we know so far:
Where did the shootings take place? 
The first shooting happened shortly before 5 p.m. March 16 at Young's Asian Massage near Woodstock, Georgia, about 30 miles northwest of downtown Atlanta. 
That shooting left four dead -- two were pronounced dead at the scene, and two others died at the hospital. One person was also wounded, Cherokee County Sheriff's Office said.
LIVE UPDATES: Atlanta spa shootings
Authorities had responded to the scene for reports of a shooting.
About an hour later, three people were found dead at the Gold Massage Spa on Piedmont Road in Atlanta, Police Chief Rodney Bryant said. 
One person was also found dead at the Aroma Therapy Spa, directly across the street.
The two Atlanta spas are on a stretch of Piedmont Road, just off Interstate 85. About a dozen other spas are located within a mile of Gold Massage and Aroma Therapy.
What's known about the victims?
Of those who died, six were Asian and two were White, Cherokee County sheriff's officials said in a joint news conference with Atlanta police on March 17. 
The four killed in the shooting near Woodstock were Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, of Acworth; Paul Andre Michels, 54, of Atlanta; Xiaojie Tan, 49, of Kennesaw; and Daoyou Feng, 44.
The injured survivor was Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, of Acworth, authorities said.
The four Atlanta victims were: Soon C. Park, 74; Hyun J. Grant, 51; Suncha Kim, 69; and Yong A. Yue, 63, according to the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office.
Of those four, three died of gunshot wounds to the head, and one died of a gunshot wound to the chest, the medical examiner's office said.
Four of those killed were of Korean ethnicity, according to South Korea's foreign ministry, which said it was in contact with its consulate in Atlanta.
What led to Long's arrest?
The Cherokee County Sheriff's Office identified Long, 21, of Woodstock, as a suspect. 
Before identifying him, Cherokee County investigators found surveillance video of a suspect near the first scene and published it on social media.
Long's family saw the image and helped authorities identify him, Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said March 17.
Investigators tracked Long's phone, and Reynolds reached out to authorities in Crisp County, well to the south, to let them know he appeared to be heading in that direction, Reynolds said.
Long's vehicle was spotted, a chase ensued on Interstate 75 in Crisp County, and a state trooper performed a maneuver that sent the SUV out of control, authorities said.
Police arrested Long and confiscated a 9mm gun from his vehicle, Cherokee County authorities said.
Video evidence -- including that showing Long's vehicle in the area of the Atlanta shootings -- suggests that Long is responsible for the killings in Atlanta, police there said.
Long has claimed responsibility for the shootings in Cherokee County and in Atlanta, the Cherokee County sheriff's office said.
He was being held March 17 in Cherokee County on four counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault, the sheriff's office said. He is also facing four counts of murder in Atlanta, according to city police.
What have officials said about Long's intentions?
Authorities have said the motive is under investigation.
Long told police he believed he has a sex addiction and that he saw the spas as ""a temptation ... that he wanted to eliminate,"" Cherokee County Sheriff's Capt. Jay Baker said March 17. 
But Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant said it was too early to know a motive.
""There's still a lot more work to be done. ... We're just not there as of yet,"" Bryant said March 17.
Some public officials have raised concerns that ethnicity had come into play, amid rising concerns nationwide about anti-Asian violence during the coronavirus pandemic. 
Reports of anti-Asian hate crimes more than doubled during the pandemic, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, Bernardino. The crimes surged amid racist rhetoric during the pandemic; many Asian Americans have been subjected to vitriol about the ""China virus"" or the ""kung flu"" -- even those who have never been to Asia.
Acknowledging most of the spa shooting victims were Asian, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said March 17, ""We know (violence against Asian Americans) is an issue that's happening around the country; it is unacceptable, it is hateful, and it has to stop.""
The Atlanta spas were ""legally operating businesses"" that were not on the authorities' radar, Bottoms said.
Long previously had frequented the two Atlanta spas, and he bought the gun used in the shooting the day of the incident, Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Charles Hampton Jr. said March 18.
Long told investigators the killings were not racially motivated, the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office said.
Where was Long headed before he was arrested?
Before he was stopped, Long was headed to Florida ""perhaps to carry out additional shootings,"" Bottoms, the Atlanta mayor, said March 17, citing investigators.
""It's very likely there would have been more victims,"" Bottoms said.
Long told investigators he was headed to Florida and was ""going to do more acts"" there, Cherokee County Sheriff's Capt. Jay Baker said March 17.
What have Long's relatives or acquaintances said about him?
Long spent time in rehabilitation for sexual addiction last year, a former roommate told CNN on March 17.
The roommate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he lived with Long for several months in summer 2020 at a transition house for people exiting rehab. He declined to identify the transition house or say which state it was in. 
Long didn't talk about his addiction, the roommate said, but had seemed to be doing better by the time he left the transition house. The roommate said he hadn't been in contact with Long ""in a long time."" 
Long seemed to have ""self-hatred,"" the roommate said. 
But overall, he said, Long seemed kind and often cooked food for his friends. The roommate also said he ""never heard him say anything racial.""
""It just doesn't make sense to me,"" the roommate said of the shooting.
Tyler Bayless said he shared a housing unit with Long at Maverick Recovery, a rehab facility in Roswell, Georgia, between August 2019 and February 2020.
""It was something that absolutely would torture him,"" Bayless said. He said Long was a ""deeply religious person -- he would often go on tangents about his interpretation of the Bible"" and was distraught about his addiction to sex.
Bayless said that on multiple occasions during his stay at the facility, Long told him that he had ""relapsed"" and ""gone to massage parlors explicitly to engage in sex acts."" 
Long ""may have frequented some of these places in the past,"" Reynolds said, referring to the shooting sites. It's not clear whether any of the three businesses offered sexual services in addition to massages. But authorities have given no indication any of the sites was operating illegally.
""We are not about to get into victim-blaming, victim-shaming here,"" Bottoms said. ""We don't know additional information about what (Long's) motives were, but we certainly will not begin to blame victims.""
CNN went to the home of Long's grandparents in Morristown, Tennessee, on March 17. ""All I want to say is that he is our grandson and we still love him very much,"" said Long's grandmother, Margaret Long, who was visibly upset. 
Long's grandfather interrupted the conversation, saying they'd been told not to speak.

Jay Baker said March 17. What have Long's relatives or acquaintances said about him? Long spent time in rehabilitation for sexual addiction last year, a former roommate told CNN on March 17. The roommate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he lived with Long for several months in summer 2020 at a transition house for people exiting rehab. He declined to identify the transition house or say which state it was in.  Long didn't talk about his addiction, the roommate said, but had seemed to be doing better by the time he left the transition house. The roommate said he hadn't been in contact with Long ""in a long time.""  Long seemed to have ""self-hatred,"" the roommate said.  But overall, he said, Long seemed kind and often cooked food for his friends. The roommate also said he ""never heard him say anything racial."" ""It just doesn't make sense to me,"" the roommate said of the shooting. Tyler Bayless said he shared a housing unit with Long at Maverick Recovery, a rehab facility in Roswell, Georgia, between August 2019 and February 2020. ""It was something that absolutely would torture him,"" Bayless said. He said Long was a ""deeply religious person -- he would often go on tangents about his interpretation of the Bible"" and was distraught about his addiction to sex. Bayless said that on multiple occasions during his stay at the facility, Long told him that he had ""relapsed"" and ""gone to massage parlors explicitly to engage in sex acts.""  Long ""may have frequented some of these places in the past,"" Reynolds said, referring to the shooting sites. It's not clear whether any of the three businesses offered sexual services in addition to massages. But authorities have given no indication any of the sites was operating illegally. ""We are not about to get into victim-blaming, victim-shaming here,"" Bottoms said. ""We don't know additional information about what (Long's) motives were, but we certainly will not begin to blame victims."" CNN went to the home of Long's grandparents in Morristown, Tennessee, on March 17. ""All I want to say is that he is our grandson and we still love him very much,"" said Long's grandmother, Margaret Long, who was visibly upset.  Long's grandfather interrupted the conversation, saying they'd been told not to speak.

The GOP's xenophobia is fueling toxic culture of hate,19/3/2021,"In addition to the sorrow for the lives lost, two troubling thoughts immediately came to mind. First, was this another instance of anti-Asian violence? And then, the elephant in the room, the question that almost didn't need to be asked: If it was a deliberate effort to kill Asians, does former President Donald Trump, who has spent more than a year referring to the coronavirus by using Asian slurs, bear any responsibility for  helping set the stage for the rising tide of anti-Asian American violence?
The answer is obvious to many. California Rep. Judy Chu, who heads the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said the former president, ""clearly stoked the flames of xenophobia"" against Asians. After public health officials named the virus Covid-19, deliberately seeking to avoid potentially xenophobic overtones, Trump ostentatiously, mockingly called it the ""China virus,"" the ""Wuhan virus,"" and the ""Kung Flu.""  According to Chu, that led to attacks on Asians increasing exponentially. And what happened in Atlanta, she argues, is the result of what Trump unleashed. Chu is hardly alone in reaching that conclusion.  
The Atlanta area shooting suspect, according to Police Captain Jay Baker, claims he wasn't looking for Asian victims, but there's much we don't know about the case. The fact that Baker, who was the spokesperson for the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office's case, has himself allegedly posted racist anti-Asian material on social media is only one more reason to be skeptical of the claim that race and national origin were not a factor. 
Whatever the killer's motives, it would be na?ve to deny a link between the skyrocketing number of attacks on Asians and the words coming out of politicians' mouths. From the US-Mexico border to the streets of Georgia, California, and across the country, those who look like they might be immigrants, no matter how many generations ago their families arrived in the US, can become targets of violence.
Politicians didn't invent prejudice, but they are exploiting it for political gain, and destroying lives in the process.
Using fear of others to further a political career is hardly new. But in the United States there's nothing in living memory quite like the anti-immigrant rhetoric Trump deployed to propel his 2016 campaign. He stoked fear of migrants, described Mexicans as rapists, murderers, and drug dealers, and generally tried to frighten voters about Muslims, Hispanics, and others. Tragically, it served him well in his campaign. He became president and he continued his xenophobic reign while in office. When he came under pressure for mismanaging the pandemic, he sought to shift blame by focusing on China's role in the disaster.
The Trump playbook has been photocopied and reenacted across a party now remade in his image. Xenophobia has become one of the preferred political tools of countless figures on the right.
During House hearings on anti-Asian violence Thursday, Texas GOP Rep. Chip Roy, somehow managed to speak approvingly of lynchings -- ""Find all the rope in Texas and get a tall oak tree...we take justice very seriously..."" -- while excoriating China's regime and its role in the pandemic. It was a virtuoso performance of false equivalency and incitement. 
But stoking racism and fear of immigrants has become one of the go-to tools of the Trumpist Republican Party.
It was Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona who apparently came up with the ""Wuhan virus,"" idea, tweeting it a year ago. It was promptly retweeted by Rep. Kevin McCarthy. Then by Trump. Then by tens of thousands of their supporters.
In 2018, the Republican gubernatorial primary in Georgia became a competition to see who could be more grotesquely anti-immigrant. The winner, now-Gov. Brian Kemp, declared ""I got a big truck,"" in his ads. ""Just in case I need to round up criminal illegal aliens and take 'em home myself.""
The entire issue of what to do at the border is treated by many Republicans more as a photo-op game than as the wrenchingly complicated human drama that it is. With the number of unaccompanied children growing at the border, Rep. McCarthy rushed there this week, saying before the TV cameras, ""This is a human heartbreak,"" and blaming it on President Joe Biden. It is, indeed, a human heartbreak. We don't know if McCarthy found Trump's policies, like forcibly taking children away from their parents at the border, a heartbreak.
The current crisis was predictable -- and predicted. After four years of Trump's brutal border policies, a new administration would almost inevitably face copious amounts of asylum seekers.
The matter is complicated. It affects millions of lives. It deserves serious discussion, not political exploitation. But that's too much to ask these days.
The United States is not the only country where xenophobia pays dividends for politicians. It is painful to see it manipulated for gain anywhere on Earth. But it is particularly disheartening to see it done in the US, where in addition to destroying lives, it threatens to rip up one of the traits that made America great: its ability to attract people from different parts of the world and allow them to make a life for themselves and become part of the country.
Politicians exploiting differences for their benefit bear part of the blame for destroying lives, they are also guilty of lacerating the very country they claim to serve.
","On Tuesday evening, when we started hearing the details of the murderous rampage that left eight people dead in the Atlanta area, a gnawing fear started taking shape. Gun violence has become eerily routine in the United States. But this time, there was nothing random about the shootings. The killer went to three separate establishments. The first one is called, ""Young's Asian Massage."" Of the eight people he killed, six were Asian women. In addition to the sorrow for the lives lost, two troubling thoughts immediately came to mind. First, was this another instance of anti-Asian violence?

Why Rand Paul's 'government worrywart' insult for Fauci is so off-base,19/3/2021,"Which is what makes Paul's repeated attempts to discredit Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has run the infectious disease operation at the National Institutes of Health since the 1980s, all the more puzzling. 
Paul had repeatedly antagonized Fauci during congressional hearings on the United States' response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Last September, he raised questions about whether the mitigation policies championed by Fauci even work. (The data says they do.) On Thursday, Paul was at it again -- questioning Fauci's claims that people who have already had the virus or have had the Covid-19 vaccine should be wearing masks, and suggesting that those who do, like Fauci, are engaging in ""theater."" (The CDC had advised vaccinated people to continue to wear masks because they could have the virus still present and pass it to other non-vaccinated people. They also could be vulnerable to other strains of the virus.)
Paul, never one to back down when facts dispute his beliefs, doubled down on his erroneous claims during an interview with ""Fox & Friends"" on Friday morning. Here's Paul:
""Dr. Fauci gets this upside-down. He's such a government worrywart that he says well, you might get [it] someday. Well, we might get anything. We might get the Spanish flu again. But that's not the way science works. He needs to show us evidence as to why. It's incumbent upon him to prove to us that we need to wear a mask, not the other way around.""
Let me quote from the CDC's guidance on how vaccinated people should behave:
""We're still learning how vaccines will affect the spread of COVID-19. After you've been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you should keep taking precautions in public places like wearing a mask, staying 6 feet apart from others, and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces until we know more.""
Now, Paul, who again is an ophthalmologist, not an epidemiologist or an infectious disease doctor, would likely take issue with guidance provided by an establishment entity like the CDC.
But here's the thing: Paul's entire argument -- against masks and the broader mitigation efforts the government has taken to contain the spread of the coronavirus -- is that we don't have any long-term studies that suggest provide clear guidance about what to do in this next phase of our fight against Covid-19. 
Again, here's Paul from ""Fox & Friends"" Friday morning:
""Instead of saying it might happen, [Fauci] needs to show me a study -- a scientific study showing that it is happening. Because I'm not willing to wear a mask for the rest of my life for something that might happen unless you show me that it actually is happening.""
Here's the problem with Paul's show-me-the-science mantra: The Covid-19 virus has only been around for 16 months or so. No one knew ANYTHING about it before it emerged in China in late 2019. So the idea that we could have definitive answers about every aspect of it -- from masking to vaccines to herd immunity -- is ridiculous. Or maybe to put a finer point on it -- it's totally unrealistic.
Paul is purposely using the lack of total clarity as to how the virus works and how we combat it to raise questions about whether what we are doing is right. But doesn't it make a lot more sense when considering a new virus that has killed more Americans than World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War combined that we err on the side of caution in these (still) early days of understanding the medium- and long-term effects of Covid-19?
Yes, yes it does. Which is why what Paul is doing -- using uncertainty to score political points -- is both irresponsible and dangerous.

US and China trade barbs after Blinken warns of need to respect global order or face a 'more violent world',19/3/2021,"By evening, the Chinese had accused the US delegation of being ""condescending"" in its tone, while a US official said the representatives from Beijing seemed ""intent on grandstanding.""
Behind closed doors and after the public clash, a senior administration official said the first session of talks ""was substantive, serious, and direct.""
""After the pool spray, Secretary Blinken opened the discussion, and both sides immediately got down to business,"" the official said in a statement to the traveling press. ""In fact, the discussion went well beyond the 2 hours we had allotted.""
""We used the session, just as we had planned, to outline our interests and priorities, and we heard the same from our Chinese counterparts,"" they said.
The two sides held a second round of talks Thursday evening, and a third and final session is scheduled for Friday morning.
However, the outset of the meeting quickly veered away from the usual diplomatic throat clearing that takes place in front of the cameras before the real meetings get underway. As the two sides traded the unusually intense remarks, Blinken called the cameras back to counter the Chinese officials' comments -- particularly their slights about US democracy -- setting off an unexpected chain of rebuttals as each side responded to the other's remarks.
The clash demonstrated that the relationship Blinken has called ""the biggest geopolitical test of the 21st century"" will be fraught and difficult as the Biden team grapples with an ascendant and increasingly assertive China abroad while it faces serious challenges at home that Beijing will seek to exploit as it attempts to underscore US weakness.
Following the public exchange, a US senior administration official said the Chinese seemed to have arrived with a focus ""on public theatrics and dramatics over substance.""
""They made that clear by promptly violating protocol; we had agreed to short (two-minute) opening statements by each principal,"" they said in a statement to the traveling press. While Blinken's and national security adviser Jake Sullivan's opening remarks stuck close to that allotment, the Chinese delegation spoke for more than 20 minutes as the conversation got increasingly more tense.
""The United States delegation came to Anchorage committed to laying out the principles, interests, and values that animate our engagement with Beijing,"" the official said. ""We have continued on with our planned presentation, knowing that exaggerated diplomatic presentations often are aimed at a domestic audience.""
On Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry pushed back on the assertion that its delegation was ""grandstanding"" and claimed the US ""made provocations first.""
""The opening remarks are just an appetizer, and the main course later is the big event,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a daily briefing.
In his opening remarks, Blinken initially said the US intends to defend the ""rules-based order"" without which there would be a ""much more violent world"" and said that Chinese activities in places like Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as its cyber attacks on the US and economic coercion of US allies, ""threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability. That's why they're not merely internal matters, and why we feel an obligation to raise these issues here today.""
China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi pushed back, warning the US against meddling in China's ""internal affairs,"" contesting the US right to speak for other countries, charging that the US is the ""champion"" of cyber attacks, mocking US domestic stability and challenging America's own record on human rights.
""We believe that it is important for the United States to change its own image, and to stop advancing its own democracy in the rest of the world,"" Yang said, in extended opening remarks. ""Many people within the United States actually have little confidence in the democracy of the United States,"" Yang said. ""According to opinion polls, the leaders of China have the wide support of the Chinese people.""  
Yang challenged the US claims to global leadership saying that ""the US does not represent the world, it only represents the government of the United States,"" before State Councilor Wang Yi weighed in to say China would not accept ""the unwarranted accusations from the US side."" 
'Hold on one second'
After Wang finished and aides started to usher cameras out of the room, Blinken interjected, ""Hold on one second please."" The top US diplomat motioned for the press to return. ""Hold on one second,"" he said. ""Director, state counselor, given your extended remarks, permit me please to add just a few of my own before we get down to work."" 
The top US diplomat said that in calls with nearly 100 counterparts, he was ""hearing deep satisfaction that the United States is back, that we're reengaged with our allies and partners. I'm also hearing deep concern about some of the actions your government is taking.""
And then Blinken addressed the jabs at US domestic affairs. A hallmark of US leadership at home is ""a constant quest to, as we say, form a more perfect union. And that quest by definition, acknowledges our imperfections, acknowledges that we're not perfect,"" Blinken said. 
""We make mistakes. We, we have reversals, we take steps back. But what we've done throughout our history is to confront those challenges -- openly, publicly, transparently -- not trying to ignore them, not trying to pretend they don't exist,"" Blinken continued. ""Sometimes it's painful. Sometimes it's ugly. But each and every time we've come out stronger, better, more united, as a country.""
Blinken then referred to a meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden when both were vice presidents. ""Biden at the time said, it's never a good bet to bet against America,"" Blinken told the Chinese officials. ""And that remains true today.""
The combative remarks opened two days of meetings in Anchorage for what US administration officials described as ""a broader strategic conversation"" about the wide range of US concerns about Chinese behavior, as well as areas of potential mutual interest. 
Blinken and Sullivan had used their opening remarks to stress their interest in a global order and the concerns they have heard from allies about China's behavior. 
""Our administration is committed to leading with diplomacy to advance the interests of the United States and to strengthen the rules-based international order,"" Blinken said. ""That system is not an abstraction. It helps countries resolve differences peacefully, coordinate multilateral efforts effectively and participate in global commerce with the assurance that everyone is following the same rules. The alternative to a rules-based order is a world in which might makes right and winners take all. And that would be a far more violent and unstable world for all of us.""
The message closely aligned with the theme administration officials had stressed in the days leading up to the Alaska meeting: the US will not shift from the increasingly tough position on Beijing taken by the Trump administration, but Biden's team has said it plans to apply those tougher standards more effectively by working closely with allies -- and they'll seek to do it without the internal divisions that plagued the Trump administration or the former President's name-calling, which many analysts say undermined US-China policy in the past. 
""Sometimes you heard one thing in public but seemed to see something different -- coming from elsewhere,"" a senior administration official said of the Trump administration. ""One of the things for us to also demonstrate here is a sense of coordination and sort of a unified approach, that it was not potentially the case in the last administration.""
The White House made clear that it was ""important"" that the meeting happen on US soil, and senior administration officials stressed that the presence of both Blinken and Sullivan demonstrate a strong united front.
""This is a very deliberate and visual demonstration of that from the get-go that we think is really important for helping to inform and shape how China seeks to engage with us,"" one senior official told reporters this week, adding that ""the games that China has played in the past to divide us or attempt to divide us are simply not going to work here.""
Blinken arrived in Alaska after a high-profile trip to South Korea and Japan alongside US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The top US diplomat used his visits to Seoul and Tokyo to emphasize US unity with its Asian allies. He also unveiled a swath of sanctions against Hong Kong and Chinese officials for their actions in Hong Kong, underscoring US impatience at Beijing's increasing aggression.
Russia and China set to meet next week
The meeting comes as Russia and China announced their own bilateral gathering next week, a diplomatic show of force that highlights their growing cooperation. Moscow announced Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov would travel to South Korean to meet officials there as well.
US officials have portrayed the Alaska meeting as a forum for airing their concerns directly with Chinese officials, ""to demonstrate to our counterparts that there is no difference between what we say in public and what we say in private,"" as Blinken said this week.
""It's just important to make sure we understand each other, and in particular that our Chinese counterparts understand the concerns that we have, understand why so many countries are increasingly worried about the actions that China is taking, again, whether it's with regard to human rights at home or some of its aggressive actions in the region,"" he said in an interview with TV Asahi Wednesday.
Those concerns range from China's aggression in the South and East China Seas to its economic practices to its human rights abuses in Xinjiang, which the administration has said amounts to genocide.
Thursday's meeting is not expected to result in ""specific negotiated deliverables"" nor will there be a joint statement, the senior official said. 
""This really is a one-off meeting,"" the official said. ""This is not the resumption of a particular dialogue mechanism or the beginning of a dialogue process.""
Blinken said last week that any potential follow-on meetings ""really have to be based on the proposition that we're seeing tangible progress and tangible outcomes on the issues of concern to us with China.""
""Beijing has been talking about its desire to change the tone of the relationship,"" a second senior administration official told reporters.
""And of course, we're going to be looking at deeds not words on that front, and we're of course coming to these discussions with a very clear eyed view about the (People's Republic of China)'s pretty poor track record of keeping its promises,"" the official said.
Blinken has called China ""the biggest geopolitical test of the 21st century"" and President Joe Biden has vowed to ""out-compete"" with the country, but the administration has also said that they will work with China where it is in US interest to do so, on issues such a climate change.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said Thursday it accepted the proposal for the talks as ""a constructive gesture showing our sincerity towards resuming China-US dialogue and exchange and improving and developing China-US relations.""
However, spokesperson Zhao Lijian said that the US should not expect a change on the range of issues it considers to be internal matters.
""On issues that bear on China's sovereignty, security and core interests, no one shall expect China to make any compromise or trade-offs,"" he said. ""China is determined and resolute in safeguarding its core interests.""
This story has been updated with further developments Friday.
","A first face-to-face meeting between US and Chinese officials got off to a heated start in Anchorage, Alaska, on Thursday as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's statement that the Biden administration would bring up ""deep concerns"" about some of China's actions around the world was met with immediate pushback from Chinese counterparts, sparking an unusually public exchange of diplomatic barbs.

China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi pushed back, warning the US against meddling in China's ""internal affairs,"" contesting the US right to speak for other countries, charging that the US is the ""champion"" of cyber attacks, mocking US domestic stability and challenging America's own record on human rights. ""We believe that it is important for the United States to change its own image, and to stop advancing its own democracy in the rest of the world,"" Yang said, in extended opening remarks. ""Many people within the United States actually have little confidence in the democracy of the United States,"" Yang said. ""According to opinion polls, the leaders of China have the wide support of the Chinese people.""   Yang challenged the US claims to global leadership saying that ""the US does not represent the world, it only represents the government of the United States,"" before State Councilor Wang Yi weighed in to say China would not accept ""the unwarranted accusations from the US side.""  'Hold on one second' After Wang finished and aides started to usher cameras out of the room, Blinken interjected, ""Hold on one second please."" The top US diplomat motioned for the press to return. ""Hold on one second,"" he said. ""Director, state counselor, given your extended remarks, permit me please to add just a few of my own before we get down to work.""  The top US diplomat said that in calls with nearly 100 counterparts, he was ""hearing deep satisfaction that the United States is back, that we're reengaged with our allies and partners. I'm also hearing deep concern about some of the actions your government is taking."" And then Blinken addressed the jabs at US domestic affairs. A hallmark of US leadership at home is ""a constant quest to, as we say, form a more perfect union. And that quest by definition, acknowledges our imperfections, acknowledges that we're not perfect,"" Blinken said.  ""We make mistakes. We, we have reversals, we take steps back. But what we've done throughout our history is to confront those challenges -- openly, publicly, transparently -- not trying to ignore them, not trying to pretend they don't exist,"" Blinken continued. ""Sometimes it's painful. Sometimes it's ugly. But each and every time we've come out stronger, better, more united, as a country."" Blinken then referred to a meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden when both were vice presidents. ""Biden at the time said, it's never a good bet to bet against America,"" Blinken told the Chinese officials. ""And that remains true today."" The combative remarks opened two days of meetings in Anchorage for what US administration officials described as ""a broader strategic conversation"" about the wide range of US concerns about Chinese behavior, as well as areas of potential mutual interest.  Blinken and Sullivan had used their opening remarks to stress their interest in a global order and the concerns they have heard from allies about China's behavior.  ""Our administration is committed to leading with diplomacy to advance the interests of the United States and to strengthen the rules-based international order,"" Blinken said. ""That system is not an abstraction. It helps countries resolve differences peacefully, coordinate multilateral efforts effectively and participate in global commerce with the assurance that everyone is following the same rules. The alternative to a rules-based order is a world in which might makes right and winners take all. And that would be a far more violent and unstable world for all of us."" The message closely aligned with the theme administration officials had stressed in the days leading up to the Alaska meeting: the US will not shift from the increasingly tough position on Beijing taken by the Trump administration, but Biden's team has said it plans to apply those tougher standards more effectively by working closely with allies -- and they'll seek to do it without the internal divisions that plagued the Trump administration or the former President's name-calling, which many analysts say undermined US-China policy in the past.  ""Sometimes you heard one thing in public but seemed to see something different -- coming from elsewhere,"" a senior administration official said of the Trump administration. ""One of the things for us to also demonstrate here is a sense of coordination and sort of a unified approach, that it was not potentially the case in the last administration."" The White House made clear that it was ""important"" that the meeting happen on US soil, and senior administration officials stressed that the presence of both Blinken and Sullivan demonstrate a strong united front. ""This is a very deliberate and visual demonstration of that from the get-go that we think is really important for helping to inform and shape how China seeks to engage with us,"" one senior official told reporters this week, adding that ""the games that China has played in the past to divide us or attempt to divide us are simply not going to work here."" Blinken arrived in Alaska after a high-profile trip to South Korea and Japan alongside US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The top US diplomat used his visits to Seoul and Tokyo to emphasize US unity with its Asian allies. He also unveiled a swath of sanctions against Hong Kong and Chinese officials for their actions in Hong Kong, underscoring US impatience at Beijing's increasing aggression. Russia and China set to meet next week The meeting comes as Russia and China announced their own bilateral gathering next week, a diplomatic show of force that highlights their growing cooperation. Moscow announced Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov would travel to South Korean to meet officials there as well. US officials have portrayed the Alaska meeting as a forum for airing their concerns directly with Chinese officials, ""to demonstrate to our counterparts that there is no difference between what we say in public and what we say in private,"" as Blinken said this week. ""It's just important to make sure we understand each other, and in particular that our Chinese counterparts understand the concerns that we have, understand why so many countries are increasingly worried about the actions that China is taking, again, whether it's with regard to human rights at home or some of its aggressive actions in the region,"" he said in an interview with TV Asahi Wednesday. Those concerns range from China's aggression in the South and East China Seas to its economic practices to its human rights abuses in Xinjiang, which the administration has said amounts to genocide. Thursday's meeting is not expected to result in ""specific negotiated deliverables"" nor will there be a joint statement, the senior official said.  ""This really is a one-off meeting,"" the official said. ""This is not the resumption of a particular dialogue mechanism or the beginning of a dialogue process."" Blinken said last week that any potential follow-on meetings ""really have to be based on the proposition that we're seeing tangible progress and tangible outcomes on the issues of concern to us with China."" ""Beijing has been talking about its desire to change the tone of the relationship,"" a second senior ",politics,POLITICS
"Biden to hit goal of 100 million vaccinations, as US prepares to send shots to Canada and Mexico",19/3/2021,"A version of this story appeared in the March 19 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.
Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said the US was planning to share 2.5 million doses of the vaccines with Mexico and 1.5 million with Canada. 
Tens of millions of doses of the vaccine have been stockpiled at US manufacturing sites. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been approved for use in dozens of countries, including Mexico and Canada, but the shot has not yet been authorized by American drug regulators. Psaki said the doses to be sent to the two countries would be a loan, with the US receiving vaccines in return in future. 
The agreement could be finalized as soon as Friday, CNN has learned. On Tuesday, Mexico's foreign minister said an announcement could come by the end of the week. 
The Biden administration has committed to having enough vaccines for all Americans before sharing doses, and if this agreement comes together it would be the first time the US has shared vaccines directly with another country. It would also likely give a major boost to vaccination efforts in Canada and Mexico, which are struggling with their vaccine roll-outs in comparison to the US. 
Friday could mark another big milestone for President Joe Biden: 100 million shots since he took office. Biden had promised to hit that number within his first 100 days in office, but he has met the goal with weeks to spare.    
Commenting on the pace of the rollout on Thursday, Biden said Americans still needed to be vigilant to prevent the spread of the virus -- cases are still on the rise in several states. 
""This is a time for optimism but it's not a time for relaxation,"" Biden cautioned. ""I need all of you to do your part. Wash your hands, stay socially distanced, keep masking up as recommended by the CDC and get vaccinated when it's your turn."" 
More than 115 million Americans have been vaccinated since the first Covid-19 shot was authorized in December, according to the latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

YOU ASKED. WE ANSWERED. 
Q: When can Americans return to normal life?  
A: States are pushing ahead with expanding Covid-19 vaccine access and rolling back restrictions on businesses and large gatherings as America seeks a return to normality. 
But experts say two barriers stand in the way of reaching herd immunity and getting back to life as we knew it: Covid-19 variants and vaccine hesitancy. 
""We're neglecting the huge number of people in the middle who need, who want to get the vaccine but may have some concerns or just don't have time to take time off of work or find child care,"" emergency physician Dr. Leana Wen told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday. ""We need to make vaccination easy for those individuals and also really clearly demonstrate what is the benefit of vaccination, make clear the messaging that vaccines are the pathway back to pre-pandemic life.""

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY 
AstraZeneca vaccine is 'safe and effective' 
The European Union's medicines regulator said on Thursday that the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine was ""safe and effective"" to use after more than a dozen EU countries, including France, Germany and Italy, suspended shots following reports that they could be linked to blood clots. Denmark and Sweden said they will not restart their rollouts, despite the European Medicines Agency's guidance.    
But even when other countries resume rollouts, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that at their current pace, Europe's vaccination campaigns aren't yet slowing transmission of the coronavirus. The continent recorded more than 1.2 million new infections last week, and more than 20,000 people a week are dying of Covid-19. ""The number of people dying from COVID-19 in Europe is higher now than it was this time last year, reflecting the widespread hold this virus has,"" Dr. Hans Kluge, WHO's regional director for Europe, said on Thursday.   
Much of Western Europe is now in the throes of a third wave of the virus. France on Thursday announced a limited Covid-19 lockdown for Paris and several other regions to combat surging cases. And the pandemic is ""moving eastwards,"" Dr. Kluge said, with infection rates and deaths in Central Europe, the Balkans and Baltic states among the highest in the world. 
As Covid-19 deaths soar in Brazil, Bolsonaro says there's a 'war' against him 
Brazil this week reported its highest daily death toll since the pandemic began, as the government appointed its fourth health minister in a year to deal with one of the world's worst outbreaks of the virus. But Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro continues to dispute the gravity of the crisis, suggesting that his detractors are blowing the scale of the pandemic out of proportion to wage a ""war"" against him politically.  
""Here it became a war against the President. It seems that people only die of Covid,"" Bolsonaro, who wasn't wearing a mask, told supporters outside the presidential palace on Thursday. ""The hospitals are 90% occupied. But we need to find out how many are from Covid and how many are from other illnesses,"" he said. 
In the coastal city of Rio de Janeiro, intensive care units are 95% full. Fifteen other state capitals are similarly verging on collapse, with ICU occupancy over 90% -- a deluge of hospitalizations that has accompanied a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in the country. While Covid-19 cases are beginning to plateau or decline in many nations, Brazil is reporting record daily numbers. More than 45,000 people have been killed in Brazil in the last month alone, and the country recorded 90,303 new cases in a single day on Wednesday. 
Cubans embark on treacherous sea journeys as economic crisis worsens 
When Beatriz Jimenez closes her eyes, she sees her daughter Lisbethy and two young grandchildren -- and they are alive. Jimenez's family left the small seaside town of Cabari└n, on Cuba's north coast, on March 4, aboard a packed smuggler's boat. 
Jimenez said her daughter Lisbethy took the trip because she had been apart from her husband in Florida for more than a year, after the pandemic forced Cuba to cut most international flights. Lisbethy had been afraid to leave her daughter Kenna Mariana, 6 years old, and Luis Nesto, 4, behind in Cuba and risk a lengthy separation. Their boat capsized in Bahamian waters, according to the Cuban foreign ministry. Some 12 survivors and one dead body were found by a Royal Bahamian Defence ship, but Lisbethy and her children were not among them. 
A worsening economic climate could push more Cubans like Lisbethy to make the desperate voyage, despite having lost their preferential status, Patrick Oppmann reports. In 2020, the economy shrank by 11%, according to Cuban government figures, as the island's tourism industry was almost entirely shut down by the pandemic.

Transplant surgeons at Northwestern Medicine in Illinois say they have successfully performed one of the first known double lung transplants on a Covid-19 patient using organs from a donor who had previously tested positive for the virus.     Researchers working to show when and how the virus first emerged in China calculate that it probably did not infect the first human being until October 2019 at the earliest. And their models showed something else: It almost didn't make it as a pandemic virus.   The coronavirus spread on an international flight, in a hotel corridor and then to household contacts despite efforts to isolate and quarantine patients, New Zealand researchers reported Thursday. Covid-19 restrictions at the first Super Nintendo World in Japan include temperature checks, mandatory mask-wearing, hand sanitizer everywhere, social distancing in line, and signs in front of roller coasters asking riders to refrain from screaming.  Officials in the South Korean capital Seoul have reversed course on controversial plans to require all foreign workers to undergo Covid-19 testing after facing a torrent of criticism from diplomatic missions and international businesses.   
TOP TIPS
Are you having more nightmares? You might be 'quaradreaming' 
The phenomenon started to be noted by physicians about a year ago, not long after lockdowns began around the world. Frontline workers were hard hit -- a June 2020 study of 100 Chinese nurses found 45% experienced nightmares, along with varying degrees of anxiety and depression. But nightmares have continued as quarantines and lockdowns stretched on, experts say. One reason: an increase in ""night owls."" 
If you are having frightening nightmares that haunt you or lead to feelings of hopelessness and depression, reach out to a mental health professional. For those experiencing less stressful ""quaradreams,"" Sandee LaMotte has these tips.

Asian American lawmakers implore Republicans to tone down rhetoric in wake of attacks,19/3/2021,"""Your president and your party and your colleagues can talk about issues with any other country that you want, but you don't have to do it by putting a bull's-eye on the back of Asian Americans across this country, on our grandparents, on our kids,"" Rep. Grace Meng, a Democrat from New York, said to Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas during a House committee hearing on discrimination against Asian Americans.
""This hearing was to address the hurt and pain of our community and to find solutions, and we will not let you take our voice from us,"" said Meng, who grew visibly emotional as she spoke.
Reports of anti-Asian hate incidents have risen in recent months, including several unprovoked violent attacks on elderly Asian Americans, with at least three in the Bay Area captured in disturbing videos this year.
Earlier Thursday during the hearing, Roy said his ""concern about this hearing is that it seems to want to venture into the policing of rhetoric in a free society, free speech, and away from the rule of law and taking out bad guys.""
Much of his opening remarks were focused on the Chinese government, including speaking out against the country's treatment of the Uighur people and its mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic.
""I think the Chinese Communist Party running the country of China, I think they're the bad guys,"" he said. 
He continued, ""I'm not going to be ashamed of saying I oppose ... the Chinese Communist Party. And when we say things like that, and we're talking about that, we shouldn't be worried about having a committee of members of Congress policing our rhetoric because some evil-doers go engage in some evil activity as occurred in Atlanta, Georgia.""
In arguing victims ""deserve justice,"" Roy also said, ""There's an old saying in Texas about find all the rope in Texas and get a tall oak tree. You know, we take justice very seriously and we ought to do that, round up the bad guys."" 
Several Democrats expressed outrage at Roy's remarks.
""He glorified lynching at this hearing,"" Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu, an immigrant from Taiwan who served active duty in the US Air Force and was at Thursday's hearing, told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront."" ""Lynching has had a profound effect on African-Americans and also Asian-Americans. The largest mass lynching in American history was against Chinese immigrants. I call on Chip Roy to apologize. He shouldn't have been glorifying lynching at this hearing and he's confusing the fears of a foreign government with what this hearing is about, which is attacks on Americans who happen to be of Asian descent.""
On CNN's ""New Day"" Friday, Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington called Roy's opening statement ""stunning.""
""First of all, the reference to lynching, proudly referencing lynching,"" Jayapal said. ""But then on top of that, the callousness of not recognizing you can criticize a country of course, but that's not what we're talking about.""
""We are talking about words, racism, discrimination that is targeted toward a group of people and that incites violence and hate across the country,"" she added.
In a statement to the Daily Caller, Roy refused to back down from his comments.
""Apparently some folks are freaking out that I used an old expression about finding all the rope in Texas and a tall oak tree about carrying out justice against bad guys. I meant it. We need more justice and less thought policing.""
'Our community is bleeding'
Thursday's hearing was the first hearing in over three decades focused on the discrimination Asian Americans face in the country. Anti-Asian hate incidents have been on the rise since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, but the racism and xenophobia against Asian immigrants and Asian Americans dates back to the 19th century.
During Thursday's hearing, several Asian American female lawmakers, including Reps. Meng, Doris Matsui, Judy Chu, Young Kim and Michelle Steel and Sen. Tammy Duckworth testified about the discrimination the community has faced. 
""Our community is bleeding. We've been in pain and for the past year we've been screaming out for help,"" Meng said.
Democratic Rep. Judy Chu, who chairs the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, testified that the ""Asian American community has reached a crisis point that cannot be ignored.""
""What started out last January as just dirty looks and verbal assault have escalated to physical attacks and violence against innocent Asian Americans,"" she added.
Some of the Democratic lawmakers on the panel contributed the rise in attacks to the rhetoric former President Donald Trump and other Republican lawmakers used in referring to Covid-19.  
Chu said the anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents were ""stoked by the words of former President Donald Trump who sought to shift blame and anger away from his own flawed response to the pandemic."" She pointed to Trump's use of ""racist slurs"" in referring to Covid-19, even after the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided the official terminology for the virus and advised not to use geographic locations in naming diseases because it creates a stigma.
Other panel witnesses included actor Daniel Dae Kim, University of Minnesota professor Erika Lee, and Asian Americans Advancing Justice president John C. Yang, along with other advocates and experts. 

Asian Americans have reported being targeted at least 500 times in the first two months of this year, according to a recent report from the organization Stop AAPI Hate. The majority of these -- 68% -- were verbal harassment, while 11% involved physical assaults, according to Stop AAPI Hate. The group said it received at least 3,795 complaints since it began tracking violence and harassment against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders on March 19 of last year.
The hearing also comes after a string of shootings in the Atlanta area left eight people dead -- six of whom were of Asian women. Though the motive of the killer is still being investigated, the killings have exacerbated existing fears among the Asian American community.
Last session of Congress, the House passed a resolution sponsored by Meng condemning anti-Asian sentiment amid the coronavirus pandemic. All but a handful of Republicans opposed the resolution, saying they condemn all forms of racism and anti-Asian sentiment, but accused Democrats of using the resolution as a vehicle to attack Trump.
Meng has reintroduced the resolution this session and has proposed a bill that would expedite Department of Justice's reviews of Covid-19 hate crimes. 
Steel, a California Republican and South Korean immigrant, has introduced a similar resolution with Democratic Rep. Katie Porter that condemns hate crimes committed against Asian-American and Pacific Islanders.
CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misquoted a remark Rep. Chip Roy made during Thursday's hearing. He argued victims ""deserve justice."" The story has also been updated with additional developments and reaction.
","Several Asian American members of Congress implored Republicans on Thursday to tone down their rhetoric in the wake of attacks on the Asian American community, with one Democratic lawmaker accusing a Republican of placing a ""bull's-eye"" on them with his comments about China. ""Your president and your party and your colleagues can talk about issues with any other country that you want, but you don't have to do it by putting a bull's-eye on the back of Asian Americans across this country, on our grandparents, on our kids,"" Rep.

Ted Lieu, an immigrant from Taiwan who served active duty in the US Air Force and was at Thursday's hearing, told CNN's Erin Burnett on ""OutFront."" ""Lynching has had a profound effect on African-Americans and also Asian-Americans. The largest mass lynching in American history was against Chinese immigrants. I call on Chip Roy to apologize. He shouldn't have been glorifying lynching at this hearing and he's confusing the fears of a foreign government with what this hearing is about, which is attacks on Americans who happen to be of Asian descent."" On CNN's ""New Day"" Friday, Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington called Roy's opening statement ""stunning."" ""First of all, the reference to lynching, proudly referencing lynching,"" Jayapal said. ""But then on top of that, the callousness of not recognizing you can criticize a country of course, but that's not what we're talking about."" ""We are talking about words, racism, discrimination that is targeted toward a group of people and that incites violence and hate across the country,"" she added. In a statement to the Daily Caller, Roy refused to back down from his comments. ""Apparently some folks are freaking out that I used an old expression about finding all the rope in Texas and a tall oak tree about carrying out justice against bad guys. I meant it. We need more justice and less thought policing."" 'Our community is bleeding' Thursday's hearing was the first hearing in over three decades focused on the discrimination Asian Americans face in the country. Anti-Asian hate incidents have been on the rise since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, but the racism and xenophobia against Asian immigrants and Asian Americans dates back to the 19th century. During Thursday's hearing, several Asian American female lawmakers, including Reps. Meng, Doris Matsui, Judy Chu, Young Kim and Michelle Steel and Sen. Tammy Duckworth testified about the discrimination the community has faced.  ""Our community is bleeding. We've been in pain and for the past year we've been screaming out for help,"" Meng said. Democratic Rep. Judy Chu, who chairs the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, testified that the ""Asian American community has reached a crisis point that cannot be ignored."" ""What started out last January as just dirty looks and verbal assault have escalated to physical attacks and violence against innocent Asian Americans,"" she added. Some of the Democratic lawmakers on the panel contributed the rise in attacks to the rhetoric former President Donald Trump and other Republican lawmakers used in referring to Covid-19.   Chu said the anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents were ""stoked by the words of former President Donald Trump who sought to shift blame and anger away from his own flawed response to the pandemic."" She pointed to Trump's use of ""racist slurs"" in referring to Covid-19, even after the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided the official terminology for the virus and advised not to use geographic locations in naming diseases because it creates a stigma. Other panel witnesses included actor Daniel Dae Kim, University of Minnesota professor Erika Lee, and Asian Americans Advancing Justice president John C. Yang, along with other advocates and experts.  Asian Americans have reported being targeted at least 500 times in the first two months of this year, according to a recent report from the organization Stop AAPI Hate. The majority of these -- 68% -- were verbal harassment, while 11% involved physical assaults, according to Stop AAPI Hate. The group said it received at least 3,795 complaints since it began tracking violence and harassment against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders on March 19 of last year. The hearing also comes after a string of shootings in the Atlanta area left eight people dead -- six of whom were of Asian women. Though the motive of the killer is still being investigated, the killings have exacerbated existing fears among the Asian American community. Last session of Congress, the House passed a resolution sponsored by Meng condemning anti-Asian sentiment amid the coronavirus pandemic. All but a handful of Republicans opposed the resolution, saying they condemn all forms of racism and anti-Asian sentiment, but accused Democrats of using the resolution as a vehicle to attack Trump. Meng has reintroduced the resolution this session and has proposed a bill that would expedite Department of Justice's reviews of Covid-19 hate crimes.  Steel, a California Republican and South Korean immigrant, has introduced a similar resolution with Democratic Rep. Katie Porter that condemns hate crimes committed against Asian-American and Pacific Islanders. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misquoted a remark Rep. Chip Roy made during Thursday's hearing. He argued victims ""deserve justice."" The story has also been updated with additional developments and reaction.",politics,POLITICS
Insults fly as Biden locks horns with Russia and China,19/3/2021,"Nasty personal insults are flying between the White House and the Kremlin even as staggeringly blunt rhetoric erupts in the administration's first big talks with China called to lay down the law on Biden's tough new policy toward the dominant Asian power.
A remarkable day of intercontinental squabbling confirmed that US relations with China have plunged to their lowest point since President Richard Nixon's pioneering mission to ""open"" the then-isolated communist state in the 1970s. US-Russia ties are, meanwhile, at their most difficult point since the fall of the Soviet Union.
A simmering feud with Russia escalated when Biden blasted Vladimir Putin as a ""killer"" in an interview this week, promoting the stung Russian strongman and his aides to brand the new US commander-in-chief old and senile.
In Alaska, meanwhile, there were extraordinary exchanges in front of the press between US and Chinese officials on Thursday.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke of ""deep concern"" he had picked up about China's behavior during a tour of Asia and condemned China for breaking rules that keep at bay a ""a more violent world."" National security adviser Jake Sullivan defended the US from Chinese critiques by saying it had ""secret sauce"" that helped it mend its imperfections -- in a clear slam of China's authoritarian state rule.
China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi then further shattered the normally choking protocol of US-China talks by asking: ""Is that the way that you had hoped to conduct this dialogue? Well, I think we thought too well of the US.""
The exchanges -- the diplomatic equivalent of a head-to-head quarrel that will reverberate across the Pacific -- prompted a senior US official to accuse the Chinese of arriving ""intent on grandstanding, focused on public theatrics and dramatics over substance.""
The most alarming feature of the showdown is how quickly it ramped up, with neither side willing to back down and each seeking to get the upper hand and have the last word in front of the cameras. This cycle of escalation will worry experts who fear that one of the many flashpoints between the rivals -- including over Taiwan or China's territorial claims in the South China Sea -- could quickly erupt into an international crisis.
Given the brittle global situation, an attempt by a new American President to flex power in such an overt manner against two nuclear rivals might seem rash. But if anything, Biden is reacting to a strategic calculus that has shifted since he served as vice president in the Obama administration, that sought to reset relations with Russia and based its China policy on managing the peaceful rise of the coming economic power in the east.
Chinese President Xi Jinping's assertive, nationalist, authoritarianism has since transformed China's global outlook and willingness to project strength. It is now locked in a regional and increasingly global competition with Washington.
While lacking the strategic weight of the former Soviet Union, Moscow has made undermining US influence and internal political cohesion a centerpiece of its global strategy -- witnessed by its meddling in two US elections.
It's clear that Biden's tough talk, boasting about a coming US economic recovery and declarations that ""America is back,"" is designed to undercut the shared view in Moscow and Beijing that the US is gravely weakened by two decades getting into and out of the Middle East, its paralyzing political divides and one of the world's worst pandemic responses.
Biden's insults for Putin and efforts to get other major Pacific powers like India, Japan, Australia and South Korea on side before meeting China send another message: that the chaotic foreign policy in which former President Donald Trump fawned over autocrats in Moscow and Beijing, ignored allies and undermined his administration's sometimes tough strategy is on history's trash heap.
Russian ex-President mocks Biden's age 
Once Cold War rivals are now trading hot rhetoric.
Biden agreed with ABC's George Stephanopoulos this week that Putin was a ""killer"" -- an extraordinary breach of protocol given that Russia remains a proud world power. He also warned the Russian leader would ""pay a price"" after US intelligence agencies concluded this week that he oversaw an effort to help Trump and harm Biden in 2020. 
With the menacing ambiguity of a mafiosi, Putin wished Biden ""good health"" in response and challenged him to test his faculties in an online debate. In case anyone missed the point, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, once seen as the great hope of reset US-Russia ties in the Obama era, responded with a direct insult referring to Biden's age as the oldest American president.

""It seems that time hasn't been kind to him. ... I can only quote Freud: 'Nothing in life is more expensive than illness and stupidity,'"" Medvedev said, according to the official TASS news agency. Not for the first time, attacks on Biden -- and his age -- by Russia and Trump seemed almost identical.
Yuval Weber, a global fellow with the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center, said Biden was sending domestic and political messages with his willingness to take on Putin so directly.
""I don't think there is any way to more aggressively and markedly differentiate himself from President Trump,"" Weber said.
""What Biden was able to do is to say to the US domestic audience as well as to Putin that there is a very different sheriff in town.""
There is, of course, a risk that personal spats between Washington and Moscow offer Putin the platform alongside the US President that he craves and thinks is Russia's right as a great power. It's hardly ideal when the men whose fingers are on the world's two most powerful nuclear buttons back themselves into rhetorical corners. Still, Biden and Putin are both seasoned leaders who are well aware of the strategic risks of what was once a superpower showdown.
And Biden's interview with ABC News also reflected the pragmatism underlying US-Russia policy. The President indicated he was willing to respond to Putin's macho approach while finding areas of common interest when they arise. He mentioned the renewal of the new START nuclear treaty in the early weeks of his administration. ""That's overwhelmingly in the interest of humanity that we diminish the prospect of a nuclear exchange,"" he said.
In reality, the US is in a stronger relative position with Russia than with China, a far more powerful adversary. And the areas of common goals with Russia are limited in what is an overwhelmingly adversarial relationship.
Washington recently accused Russia's SVR foreign spy agency of masterminding the massive and vast ""Solar Winds"" hack on US private companies and several top government departments. Washington has spoken out strongly in support of opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who survived a poisoning that he blames on the Russian state and was imprisoned on his recent return to the country. Biden's team also opposes Moscow's annexation and continued occupation of Crimea. And it has pledged to reinvigorate the NATO alliance -- which was frequently denigrated by Trump and has long been a key instrument of US global power.
'Adversarial when it must be'
Meetings between American and Chinese diplomats never publicly display the unpleasant scenes that unfolded in Alaska, which reflect the soaring tensions between a bullish China and an America defending its global primacy.
Things got off to a bad start after US officials made clear the talks were solely aimed at putting China on notice that Biden plans to cement the Trump team's shift from seeking cooperation with Beijing to open competition.

""Our relationship with China will be competitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be, and adversarial when it must be. And we will engage China from a position of strength,"" Blinken said this month.
Washington this week clamped sanctions on Hong Kong and mainland officials over the crackdown on democracy in the former British colony. In another step that angered Beijing, the US Commerce Department issued subpoenas on multiple Chinese tech companies to see if they posed a national security risk in the United States.
There has been plenty of buzz in the foreign policy world about the possibility of a new Cold War between the US and China. If anything, that 20th century term fails to encapsulate the breadth of the contested issues and the fact that unlike the Soviet Union, the rising Asian power is embedded in the global economy.
US-China disputes on Taiwan, Hong Kong, repression of Uyghur Muslims, South China Sea sovereignty, espionage and the theft of US intellectual property are vast. And Xi's China wields an industrial base and supply chains that are crucial to Western economies. Advanced technology also gives Beijing backdoors into the modern infrastructure of its potential enemies, meaning that any new Cold War will likely take place in cyberspace.
Reflecting its growing might, senior officials in the Xi era are far more willing to rebuke Washington than in nearly half a century of US-China relations.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian bristled at a US-Japan joint statement this week, part of an effort by the Biden administration to create a united front of allies as a counter to China's economic, strategic and military power designed to force Beijing to accept international rules that China rejects as an attempt to curtail its power.
""The international community will have a fair judgment on who is the biggest threat to world peace,"" Zhao said, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.
One lesson of US foreign policy in recent decades is that plans hatched in Washington often don't survive contact with the outside world. So Biden's plan comes with some risk. A more assertive US approach could play into Xi's nationalistic worldview and, if events in Alaska are any guide, has already caused Beijing to be even more aggressive. A tense overall relationship could scupper US hopes to forge agreements with China on combating climate change at a global summit in Scotland this year. 
And there is no certainty that US allies will buy into the Biden strategy. Asian nations must live with the reality of China's growing power in their own strategic neighborhoods. Many doubt the US attention span after various pivots toward and away from Asia in recent decades. And it is far from clear that the European Union wants to pick between the US and China -- and sent a signal to that effect by signing a trade deal with Beijing just before Biden took office.
","President Joe Biden is suddenly waging a bitter two-front confrontation with America's foe in the last Cold War -- Moscow -- and the US adversary in a possible next one -- China.

This country has just been named the happiest in the world,19/3/2021,,"To say the past year has been a difficult one for people across the globe is something of an understatement.  Not only has the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in the deaths of over 2.6 million people worldwide, it's also led to a massive shake up in everyday life for many of us.  But despite the devastating events of the last 12 months and the resulting decline in mental health in a number of destinations, there's been no change at the top spot when it comes to ranking the happiest country in the world. For the fourth year running, Finland has come out on top in the annual list powered by data from the Gallup World Poll, with Iceland, Denmark, Switzerland, and the Netherlands following in second, third, fourth and fifth position respectively. While the United States moved up from 18th to 14th place and the United Kingdom dropped from 13th to 18th, Australia held its 12th place position. ""We need urgently to learn from Covid-19,"" said report co-editor Jeffrey Sachs, professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. ""The pandemic reminds us of our global environmental threats, the urgent need to cooperate, and the difficulties of achieving cooperation in each country and globally.""  Movers and shakers It's worth noting that the World Happiness Report 2021 has been collated slightly differently this time round due to coronavirus. Not only were researchers unable to complete face-to-face interviews in a number of countries, they also had to switch things up entirely by focusing on the relationship between wellbeing and Covid-19. The report has been primarily based on levels of GDP, life expectancy, generosity, social support, freedom and corruption income since it launched in 2012.  Although there have been some changes in the top 10, with Iceland rising two places from fourth to second on the list and Norway dropping from fifth to eighth place, the rankings were strikingly similar to the previous year for the most part, which is viewed as a positive sign.  ""Surprisingly there was not, on average, a decline in wellbeing when measured by people's own evaluation of their lives,"" said the University of British Columbia's professor John Helliwell, who also contributed to the report. ""One possible explanation is that people see Covid-19 as a common, outside threat affecting everybody and that this has generated a greater sense of solidarity and fellow-feeling.""   Other notable movements on the list include Germany, which has jumped from 17th to seventh place in the last year. Croatia, which was among the destinations where face-to-face interviews were able to take place, rose from number 79 to 23 on the list.  Trust factor Researchers say it's no surprise that Finland has retained the top position once again, as the Nordic country has always ranked highly when it comes to mutual trust. Trust is recognized as one of the major factors that helped to protect people during the pandemic, as well as confidence in governments. For instance, Brazil's death rate was significantly higher than Singapore's, a fact the report put partially down to the difference in public trust in the governments of each country. It also notes that the Americas and Europe had much higher Covid-19 fatalities than East Asia, Australasia, and Africa.  The report suggests that the average age of a country's population, whether it's an island, and its proximity to other highly-infected countries were contributing factors in the disparity between death rates globally. Intriguingly, cultural differences such as whether the head of government was a woman, are also noted as significant considerations when measuring the success of Covid-19 strategies, along with income inequality and knowledge gained from previous epidemics.  ""The East Asian experience shows that stringent government policies not only control Covid-19 effectively, but also buffer the negative impact of daily infections on people's happiness,"" said report contributor professor Shun Wang of the Korea Development Institute.  While successful vaccine rollouts in various countries have provided a much-needed boost to many, lockdowns, social distancing, face coverings and travel restrictions are part and parcel of living with the virus, and that's not even taking the economic implications into account. Covid impact on wellbeing As a result, the report found that the decline in mental health was immediate in many countries, including the UK, where the number of mental health problems reported was 47% higher in May 2020 than predicted before Covid-19. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the World Happiness Report 2021 also found that lockdowns and social distancing impacted workforce wellbeing tremendously. According to the data collected, those unable to work due to furlough or redundancy who said they were lonely at the start of the pandemic became 43% less happy than those who did not feel lonely to begin with. ""My previous research showed how happy workers are 13% more productive,"" said professor Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, Director of the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford, another contributor to the report.  ""This paper proves that happiness is not driven by pay, and that the social connections and a sense of identity are more important.  ""These findings point towards a 'hybrid' future of work, with a balance between office life and working from home to maintain social connections while ensuring flexibility for workers.""  Of the 149 countries featured on the report, Afghanistan was ranked the most unhappy once again, followed by Zimbabwe, Rwanda and Botswana. Those at the bottom of the list were mainly underdeveloped countries where issues such as political and armed conflicts are prevalent, or have been in recent times.  ""This has been a very challenging year, but the early data also show some notable signs of resilience in feelings of social connection and life evaluations"" says report contributor professor Lara Aknin of Simon Fraser University.

"5 things to know for March 19: Covid-19, China, spa shootings, Cuomo, abortion",19/3/2021,"(You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.)
1. Coronavirus
Europe missed its chance to stop a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic before it got out of control. Now, with new lockdowns being imposed across the continent, it's paying a high price. Some experts blame Europe's current problems on politicians being too quick to ease restrictions. American public health officials worry the US could be next. States are pushing ahead with rolling back restrictions on businesses and large gatherings. And while Covid-19 vaccine access is rapidly expanding, two obstacles stand in the way of herd immunity and a return to normal life: highly contagious Covid-19 variants and vaccine hesitancy. In other news, the CDC is expected to update its physical distancing guidelines for schools from 6 feet to 3 feet today, saying it would make no significant difference in Covid-19 transmission rates.?
2. China
When it was announced that US and Chinese officials would be meeting in Alaska this week, it seemed like this could mark the start of a new relationship between the two countries. ""So much for a reset,"" writes CNN's James Griffiths. The first meeting got off to a particularly heated start. After US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration would bring up ""deep concerns"" about some of China's actions around the world, Chinese officials pushed back. They warned the US against meddling in their ""internal affairs"" and said it should ""stop advancing its own democracy in the rest of the world."" For now, it appears that not much has changed since the major deterioration in relations we saw in the final year of President Trump's term. A final set of talks is expected to begin today.

3. Spa shootings
We're starting to learn more about the victims who were killed when a gunman opened fire in three metro Atlanta spas earlier this week. Investigators are trying to piece together the movements and the motive of the suspect. Meanwhile, there's a fierce debate underway over whether he should face hate crime charges for the attacks that left eight people, six of them Asian women, dead. President Biden and Vice President Harris are heading to Georgia today in a trip that had previously been planned to promote their Covid-19 relief package. They now plan to meet with Asian American leaders.?

4. Gov. Cuomo
The third former staffer to publicly accuse New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo of inappropriate conduct answered questions from investigators yesterday about her time in the governor's office between 2013 and 2015. ""It was a toxic, verbally abusive, retaliatory workplace, especially for young women like myself,"" Ana Liss said. It's the latest development regarding the investigation into multiple sexual harassment allegations facing the governor. Two other former staffers met with investigators earlier this week. Cuomo has repeatedly denied the allegations.

5. Abortion
The US Supreme Court justices are expected to meet privately today to consider whether to take up Mississippi's ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Conservative justices on the bench have shown that they want to topple abortion rights, but they can't seem to agree on how far they will go, writes CNN's Joan Biskupic. Their aims, based on recent writings, range from reversing Roe v. Wade, to forbidding clinics from challenging restrictions on behalf of women, to relaxing the standard that states must meet to limit women's access to the procedure. Though the justices could decide to take up the case, they may also wait to take up one of several other abortion laws heading their way.

(You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Coronavirus Europe missed its chance to stop a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic before it got out of control. Now, with new lockdowns being imposed across the continent, it's paying a high price. Some experts blame Europe's current problems on politicians being too quick to ease restrictions. American public health officials worry the US could be next. States are pushing ahead with rolling back restrictions on businesses and large gatherings. And while Covid-19 vaccine access is rapidly expanding, two obstacles stand in the way of herd immunity and a return to normal life: highly contagious Covid-19 variants and vaccine hesitancy. In other news, the CDC is expected to update its physical distancing guidelines for schools from 6 feet to 3 feet today, saying it would make no significant difference in Covid-19 transmission rates.? 2. China When it was announced that US and Chinese officials would be meeting in Alaska this week, it seemed like this could mark the start of a new relationship between the two countries. ""So much for a reset,"" writes CNN's James Griffiths. The first meeting got off to a particularly heated start. After US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration would bring up ""deep concerns"" about some of China's actions around the world, Chinese officials pushed back. They warned the US against meddling in their ""internal affairs"" and said it should ""stop advancing its own democracy in the rest of the world."" For now, it appears that not much has changed since the major deterioration in relations we saw in the final year of President Trump's term. A final set of talks is expected to begin today. 3. Spa shootings We're starting to learn more about the victims who were killed when a gunman opened fire in three metro Atlanta spas earlier this week. Investigators are trying to piece together the movements and the motive of the suspect. Meanwhile, there's a fierce debate underway over whether he should face hate crime charges for the attacks that left eight people, six of them Asian women, dead. President Biden and Vice President Harris are heading to Georgia today in a trip that had previously been planned to promote their Covid-19 relief package. They now plan to meet with Asian American leaders.? 4. Gov. Cuomo The third former staffer to publicly accuse New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo of inappropriate conduct answered questions from investigators yesterday about her time in the governor's office between 2013 and 2015. ""It was a toxic, verbally abusive, retaliatory workplace, especially for young women like myself,"" Ana Liss said. It's the latest development regarding the investigation into multiple sexual harassment allegations facing the governor. Two other former staffers met with investigators earlier this week. Cuomo has repeatedly denied the allegations. 5. Abortion The US Supreme Court justices are expected to meet privately today to consider whether to take up Mississippi's ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Conservative justices on the bench have shown that they want to topple abortion rights, but they can't seem to agree on how far they will go, writes CNN's Joan Biskupic. Their aims, based on recent writings, range from reversing Roe v. Wade, to forbidding clinics from challenging restrictions on behalf of women, to relaxing the standard that states must meet to limit women's access to the procedure. Though the justices could decide to take up the case, they may also wait to take up one of several other abortion laws heading their way.

Alaska dispute between US and Chinese officials an inauspicious start to a new era of relations,19/3/2021,"When it was first revealed that top officials from the United States and China would be meeting in Alaska this week, there was a degree of optimism this could mark the start of a new relationship between the two countries, after an almost complete breakdown during the final year of President Donald Trump's term. 
Last month, following a call between President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, who is taking part in the Alaska summit, said ""in the past few years, China-US relations deviated from the normal track, and ran into the biggest difficulties since the establishment of diplomatic ties."" 
Wang called for a reset, and Chinese state media speculated an ""Alaska moment"" could provide the opportunity for just that. 
But as the summit neared, both sides began signaling that any room for compromise was small, downplaying the chances of real progress. This culminated in China's ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, saying Thursday he had no ""high expectations"" for the Alaska talks. 
Even Cui may have been surprised at just what an acrimonious start those talks got off to, however. After US Secretary of State Antony Blinken read prepared remarks for journalists invited to watch the opening of the meeting, in which he promised to bring up ""deep concerns"" the Biden administration had with some Chinese actions, Beijing's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, immediately pushed back. 
Yang warned the US to stop meddling in China's ""internal affairs"" and said it should ""stop advancing its own democracy in the rest of the world,"" adding that many Americans ""actually have little confidence in the democracy of the United States."" 
His remarks went far beyond the two minutes US officials said they had agreed upon before the talks, and Blinken insisted on issuing a rebuttal while the media was still present, with the Chinese then accusing him of being ""condescending,"" as their US counterparts complained of ""grandstanding."" 

In a write-up of the exchange, published hours after it took place, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said it was the US side that was ""seriously exceeding the time limit"" in their opening remarks and ""provoking dispute"" by launching ""unreasonable attacks"" on China's domestic and foreign policies.
Exchanges behind closed-doors appear to have been more congenial, however. A senior White House official told reporters after the first session finished that talks were ""substantive, serious, and direct.""
""We used the session, just as we had planned, to outline our interests and priorities, and we heard the same from our Chinese counterparts,"" they said, before the second set of talks began. 
That meeting is expected to stretch into the late Alaskan evening, with the final set of talks due to begin Friday morning local time. 
'Biggest geopolitical test'
Since before Biden was elected last year, Beijing has made clear that while it desires a reset of relations with Washington, it wants one on its own terms. 
While China's global reputation was damaged by the coronavirus pandemic, the country has emerged largely unscathed economically, and politically the Communist Party is even more secure than ever, as demonstrated by renewed crackdowns in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. 
Since 2010, China has been calling for a ""new model of major-power relations,"" a framework for a more balanced relationship that has been largely rejected by Washington. But Biden is perhaps the first US President to be facing a China which sees itself as on a level playing field with the US, and is not content to play the role of junior partner. 
In an editorial earlier this month, the state-run China Daily said ""hopes were high that (the Biden administration) would work with China to get bilateral relations onto a more positive track."" 
While Beijing has made it clear it prefers a stable relationship, the aggressive moves by the Trump administration also demonstrated China can weather a lot of what the US has to throw at it, be it trade tariffs, sanctions, or diplomatic pressure. 
After Biden claimed to have had a ""robust"" call with Xi last month, Chinese state media framed the discussion very differently, with Xi appearing to dismiss Washington's concerns about Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan, saying ""the US side should respect China's core interests and act prudently."" 
Beijing may have been hoping for a relationship more like that it enjoyed during Biden's last stint in government, under President Barack Obama, whose rhetoric about being tough with China and a supposed ""pivot to Asia"" did not have much effect on the two countries' economic ties, nor according to critics, do much to restrain Chinese territorial ambitions. 

Blinken, for his part, has made it clear that this is not on the cards. He has called the US-China relationship ""the biggest geopolitical test of the 21st century,"" and ahead of the Alaska meeting this week, rallied Washington's allies in the region against Beijing. 
One extra wrinkle in the talks comes with the trial of two Canadians held in China on espionage charges. Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig were detained in 2018 after the US sought the extradition from Canada of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. 
Spavor's trial began on Friday in Dandong, China, as officials were meeting in Alaska. Previously both Blinken and Biden have urged Beijing to release the two men, whose detention Ottawa and Washington regard as arbitrary and political, and doing so -- potentially after a face-saving conviction and sentence of time-served -- could be an easy sign of good will from Beijing. 
According to Chinese state media and Canadian officials at the scene, Spavor's trial wrapped up in a matter of hours. A statement on the website of Liaoning Dandong Intermediate People's Court said that a verdict would be announced ""at a later date in accordance with the law."" Kovrig's trial is expected to begin Monday. 
United front
Such good will could be in short supply however, depending on how high hopes were from Beijing going into the Alaska summit. 
For its part, Washington made clear this week it was not prepared to compromise. Speaking in Tokyo, Blinken promised the US ""will push back if necessary when China uses coercion or aggression to get its way.""
His Japanese counterpart, Toshimitsu Motegi, said the ""free and open international order is greatly challenged by attempts to change the status quo by force and progress of authoritarian system,"" and added Tokyo and Washington agreed on the need to hold Beijing to account. 
A similar message was delivered in Seoul days later, where South Korean President Moon Jae-in said his country and the US would ""continue to act together on shared challenges."" 
While Trump enjoyed outwardly positive relationships with both Moon and former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his policies toward US allies in the region were often unpredictable, veering between ramping up cooperation on some fronts, while threatening to force both Japan and South Korea to pay for US troop bases in the respective countries, or slapping them with trade tariffs. 
In his speech this week, Moon appeared to criticize Trump when he welcomed the ""return of diplomacy and alliance"" with the US. 
Such stronger ties could be of concern to Beijing, whose aggressive moves along its maritime and land borders have rattled many neighbors. India, in particular, long a neutral party in the US-China relationship, has moved much closer to Washington amid border clashes with Chinese forces in the Himalayas. 
This month, Biden met virtually with the leaders of Japan, India and Australia, a grouping known informally as ""the Quad,"" and the four later issued a joint statement saying they were ""committed to a free, open, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region,"" seen as a message to Beijing. 
While not a formal military alliance like NATO, the Quad, or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, is seen by some as a potential counterweight to growing Chinese influence and alleged aggression in the Asia-Pacific region, and there have been suggestions South Korea could join, further strengthening the alliance. 
The collation has been denounced by Beijing as an anti-China bloc, but it is one that -- if translated into a more cohesive alliance -- could have a real effect in influencing Chinese policy. 
And with the talks in Alaska appearing unlikely to result in closer ties between Washington and Beijing, China's leaders could be feeling apprehensive for what that could result in.

China is raising the alarm over corporate surveillance. But it's got a massive network of its own,19/3/2021,"The firestorm first erupted Monday during a two-hour primetime program called ""315"" that coincides with World Consumer Rights Day. The program is frequently used by China's state media to lambast brands over perceived shortcomings ！ Nike (NKE), McDonald's (MCD) and Apple (AAPL) have all been targeted by the show in prior years.
This year, concerns about surveillance and privacy were front-and-center. Chinese state broadcaster China Central Television, or CCTV, used the program to accuse several companies of secretly collecting data about their customers using facial recognition ！ notably, without mentioning the massive network of facial recognition cameras that the Chinese government has built, capable of tracking people in real time.
CCTV accused the Chinese unit of American manufacturer Kohler, for example, of installing cameras in hundreds of its stores in China and capturing the faces of customers to analyze their gender and age, among other details.
""No matter which store the customers visit, or how many times they go, Kohler would know,"" the Chinese state broadcaster reported during the program. It also singled out a BMW (BMWYY) dealership and a Max Mara retail store in the Shanghai area for using similar technology.
Nationwide uproar
While those brands weren't the only ones criticized by the program ！ big foreign companies like Ford (F) and Nissan's (NSANF) Infiniti brand were also accused of poor behavior, such as defects with car parts or other disputes ！ it's the surveillance issue that appears to have gained the most traction.
CCTV posts about the claims have generated tens of thousands of comments on the social media platform Weibo, where people worried about whether their personal information was being abused.
""It's not just Kohler,"" wrote one Weibo user. ""Did you forget even our residential buildings require facial recognition?""
Kohler wrote on its official Weibo account on Tuesday that it had ""already arranged"" for its stores to remove the cameras ""overnight,"" and would power off any devices that it could not physically dismantle. The company denied, however, that it had stored or analyzed any data it collected with the cameras, adding that it only used them to count customer arrivals.
Zhengtong Auto, a luxury car dealer that operates the BMW (BMWYY) store, said it had removed its cameras, too. And Chinese state media reported that Max Mara suspended the use of store cameras, though the company added that it was only using data to count customer traffic.
Chinese authorities, meanwhile, have started investigating some of the companies featured on the program. Prosecutors announced Wednesday that they would open a probe into Ovopark, a Chinese company that supplied cameras to Kohler. Regulators in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Shanghai all said they would investigate companies accused of misusing facial recognition data, too.
A 'far cry' from Beijing's surveillance network
The ""315"" show has broadcast in China for decades, often focusing on hot-button consumer rights issues of the moment.
It's well known for eliciting a quick response from the companies accused of bad behavior. Apple CEO Tim Cook even apologized in 2013 after the company's warranty services were criticized on the show.
This year's focus on privacy and surveillance highlights rising worries in China about the use of such technology in the digital age, according to Willy Lam, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who studies Chinese politics and societal issues.
It's not just Weibo users who have gotten wrapped up in the fallout, either.
""The '315' program is a reminder of how easily people's facial IDs can be obtained"" and ""how rampant the use of the technology is,"" wrote the editorial board of the Guangming Daily, a major state-owned national newspaper, on Wednesday. ""Our regulation is lacking behind in the facial recognition industry.""
But state-driven concerns about privacy and surveillance might ring a bit hollow to some.
""Impinging on people's privacy isn't a good look for Kohler and BMW, but it's a far cry [from] China's massive [closed-circuit television] surveillance network,"" said Paul Bischoff, a consumer privacy expert and the editor of Comparitech, a UK-based technology research firm.
CCTV reported in 2017 that more than 20 million cameras had been installed across China at that time for the purpose of ""maintaining public security."" And the total number through now may be much higher: China had 349 million surveillance cameras installed as of 2018, nearly five times the number of cameras in the United States, according to a report from IHS Markit Technology.
Lam said that Beijing may think that stopping companies ！ and especially foreign ones ！ from obtaining large amounts of biometric information is a responsible decision.
But the government still has a much farther reach than businesses to when it comes to surveillance. And Lam added that since discussions about such projects are restricted in mainland China, the public may not be aware of how far Beijing's reach extends.
""Yes, some tech companies do collect and store people's photos to use in face recognition applications. And I support regulations restricting such data collection without consent,"" said Bischoff. ""US and European laws still lag behind in that regard. But unlike China, these applications are not being used to restrict freedom of movement or assembly.""
Lam also suggested that the program ！ along with the fallout that has stemmed from it ！ points to another longstanding government priority: making sure that businesses know they aren't above the government.
""It's a reminder that companies need to listen and play by the rules,"" he added.

The bias facing Black and Asian Americans reflects a broader problem,19/3/2021,"From ex-President Donald Trump's slurs about ""the China virus"" and ""kung flu"" to the stigma inflicted by association with the pathogen first discovered in Wuhan, many Asian Americans say they've had targets on their backs for months. 
Hate crimes against them are up 150% since Covid-19 reached US shores. Some Asian Americans have been spat on or told to go back ""home."" Basketball star Jeremy Lin was called ""coronavirus"" on court.  In particularly horrific attacks, Asian American seniors have been targeted -- leaving some elderly residents of West coast cities scared to leave their homes. 
Anti-Asian bias is nothing new in this country, though the struggle for equality by African Americans has often been a more dominant story. In 1871, a group of Chinese men were lynched in Los Angeles. Chinese laborers long faced grave discrimination in the US, and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II is a stain on the country's history.
The current tide of hate directed toward Asian Americans comes at a moment of racial reckoning triggered by the killing of Black men by White police officers,  including the late George Floyd, which ignited a global Black Lives Matter movement. And community advocates say the bias facing Black and Asian Americans reflects a broader problem of hate and White supremacist ideology in the country.
""While the focus is on anti-Asian hate, it all stems from White supremacy and anyone can be a scapegoat at any moment,"" said Vivien Tsou, national field director for the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum.
'A lot of Asian Americans are looking over their shoulders'
NBA player Jeremy Lin has been called ""coronavirus"" on court. On Wednesday, he described confronting racism in America amid the pandemic with CNN's Anderson Cooper.
""It feels very different. I think growing up it was always something that might be a little more subtle or verbal, but I think what we're seeing right now is a lot of physical actual violence, lives being taken. A lot of Asian Americans are looking over their shoulders when they go outside, when they go to the grocery store, and we're starting to slowly see more and more reporting of what is going on.
""You can even hear in the audio recordings, the cheers, the laughs, from everybody in those situations when, you know, it was called the 'kung flu virus' and everyone is cheering. I think there is a lot of racially charged hatred right now that we're seeing and feeling.
""If you look back into history, a lot of this stuff I never learned, never heard about until I had to go dig it up myself. But you look at how Chinatown came to existence, if you look at the Japanese camps or the Chinese Exclusion Act -- the first legislation and only legislation that banned a specific person from coming in -- I mean, I feel like Asian and Asian American experience has often been not talked about.
""Asian immigrants have come over and basically just been told what to do and to be quiet and to stay under the radar and to not cause any noise, and I think with this next generation as we're starting to see more and more of this happening, Asian Americans are no longer wanting to just be told what to do and keep our heads down, work hard and say nothing.""
'Vaccine, vaccine and vaccine!'
As President Joe Biden contemplates sharing excess AstraZeneca vaccines with continental neighbors Canada and Mexico, a familiar voice from the far southern end of the Americas is calling on him to ensure fair vaccine distribution around the world.
Speaking with CNN's Christiane Amanpour from Sao Paulo, Brazil, former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said Wednesday that the US vaccine surplus could be donated to countries in need. ""One suggestion that I would like to make to President Biden through your program is: It's very important to call a G20 meeting urgently,"" da Silva told Amanpour.

","Officials have not yet confirmed the motive for a horrific shooting spree at Asian spas in the state of Georgia. But the outrage has sent a new wave of fear and horror through a minority community already traumatized by attacks and harassment during the pandemic. From ex-President Donald Trump's slurs about ""the China virus"" and ""kung flu"" to the stigma inflicted by association with the pathogen first discovered in Wuhan, many Asian Americans say they've had targets on their backs for months.  Hate crimes against them are up 150% since Covid-19 reached US shores. Some Asian Americans have been spat on or told to go back ""home."" Basketball star Jeremy Lin was called ""coronavirus"" on court.  In particularly horrific attacks, Asian American seniors have been targeted -- leaving some elderly residents of West coast cities scared to leave their homes.  Anti-Asian bias is nothing new in this country, though the struggle for equality by African Americans has often been a more dominant story. In 1871, a group of Chinese men were lynched in Los Angeles. Chinese laborers long faced grave discrimination in the US, and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II is a stain on the country's history. The current tide of hate directed toward Asian Americans comes at a moment of racial reckoning triggered by the killing of Black men by White police officers,  including the late George Floyd, which ignited a global Black Lives Matter movement. And community advocates say the bias facing Black and Asian Americans reflects a broader problem of hate and White supremacist ideology in the country. ""While the focus is on anti-Asian hate, it all stems from White supremacy and anyone can be a scapegoat at any moment,"" said Vivien Tsou, national field director for the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum. 'A lot of Asian Americans are looking over their shoulders' NBA player Jeremy Lin has been called ""coronavirus"" on court. On Wednesday, he described confronting racism in America amid the pandemic with CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""It feels very different. I think growing up it was always something that might be a little more subtle or verbal, but I think what we're seeing right now is a lot of physical actual violence, lives being taken. A lot of Asian Americans are looking over their shoulders when they go outside, when they go to the grocery store, and we're starting to slowly see more and more reporting of what is going on. ""You can even hear in the audio recordings, the cheers, the laughs, from everybody in those situations when, you know, it was called the 'kung flu virus' and everyone is cheering. I think there is a lot of racially charged hatred right now that we're seeing and feeling. ""If you look back into history, a lot of this stuff I never learned, never heard about until I had to go dig it up myself. But you look at how Chinatown came to existence, if you look at the Japanese camps or the Chinese Exclusion Act -- the first legislation and only legislation that banned a specific person from coming in -- I mean, I feel like Asian and Asian American experience has often been not talked about. ""Asian immigrants have come over and basically just been told what to do and to be quiet and to stay under the radar and to not cause any noise, and I think with this next generation as we're starting to see more and more of this happening, Asian Americans are no longer wanting to just be told what to do and keep our heads down, work hard and say nothing."" 'Vaccine, vaccine and vaccine!' As President Joe Biden contemplates sharing excess AstraZeneca vaccines with continental neighbors Canada and Mexico, a familiar voice from the far southern end of the Americas is calling on him to ensure fair vaccine distribution around the world. Speaking with CNN's Christiane Amanpour from Sao Paulo, Brazil, former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said Wednesday that the US vaccine surplus could be donated to countries in need. ""One suggestion that I would like to make to President Biden through your program is: It's very important to call a G20 meeting urgently,"" da Silva told Amanpour. ""It's important to call the main leaders of the world and put around the table just one thing, one issue: vaccine, vaccine and vaccine!""

Biden poised to tap former Sen. Bill Nelson to lead NASA,19/3/2021,"Nelson, who flew a space shuttle mission more than three decades ago, has been a long proponent of NASA. He is not an astronaut, but is one of the rare civilians who has traveled to space. 
The Verge was first to report this decision.
Though the vast majority of NASA employees have long-term careers at the space agency, it is common for incoming presidents to install new leadership at NASA's headquarters in Washington, DC.
If confirmed by the Senate, Nelson would succeed Jim Bridenstine, a Trump appointee who took office in 2018 after serving in Congress. Though Bridenstine's appointment was initially met with broad pushback on Capitol Hill, the former Oklahoma congressman managed to gain respect from the space community and many stakeholders pressed the Biden camp to keep Bridenstine in his role.
But Bridenstine told Aviation Week in November that NASA will ""need somebody who is trusted by the administration"" and that he would exit the role. 
""What you need is somebody who has a close relationship with the president of the United States. You need somebody who is trusted by the administration ... including the OMB (Office of Management and Budget), the National Space Council and the National Security Council, and I think that I would not be the right person for that in a new administration,"" Bridenstine told the outlet. 
Nelson had been a sharp critic of Bridenstine during his confirmation hearing, saying at the time, ""I have come to believe that the position of NASA administrator, as I have said so many times in front of this committee, obviously should not be one that is partisan.""
""It is a position where a failure of leadership can quite literally mean the difference between life and death,"" Nelson said, later concluding that he felt Bridenstine's qualifications fell short of what's necessary for a NASA administrator.
Nelson's time in the Senate also previewed the fierce advocacy for a substantial NASA budget that he is likely to take to the role if confirmed. 
After then-President Barack Obama moved to slash funding for NASA's moon mission program in 2010, Nelson told CNN the decision could cause the US to fall behind other countries in space exploration.
""If they don't push hard now for research and development of the new big rocket that'll take us out of low-Earth orbit and let us explore the heavens, then we are going to be falling behind China and Russia, and that's something I don't think will sit well with the American people.""

Asian American communities on edge after deadly Atlanta-area shootings,19/3/2021,,"A candlelight vigil was held Thursday outside Young¨s Asian Spa, where four people were killed and one person wounded. The four killed in the shooting near Woodstock, Georgia, were Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, of Acworth; Paul Andre Michels, 54, of Atlanta; Xiaojie Tan, 49, of Kennesaw; and Daoyou Feng, 44. The injured survivor was Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, of Acworth, authorities said. ＾We are at a loss of words of why, but we are committed to building a solid case and working with the FBI, the city of Atlanta and Crisp County Sheriff¨s Office to present a solid case to have a successful result of prosecution,￣ said Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds who attended the vigil. ＾Tonight is about these individuals and their lives, what they meant to their families and what they meant to our communities,￣ Reynolds said. He told reporters that he wanted to let the Asian American community know that ＾we have them in our hearts and our prayers and we¨re so sorry for the loss of life."" The sheriff said he grew up in Cherokee County and was a patrol sergeant in the same area where the spa is located. ＾For me, this is the worst thing I have seen in our community. It breaks my heart that this happens in other places and now here in our community,￣ Reynolds said. The sheriff¨s office is still looking at all possibilities and asking anyone with any additional information on the suspect to contact them. Reynolds said that as of right now, there is no evidence to suggest that this was a racially-motivated attack but they are not ruling out any possibility. The suspect in the Atlanta spa shootings, Robert Aaron Long, asked officers taking him to a jail cell if he was ＾going to be here for the rest of his life,￣ according to the incident report released by the Crisp County Sheriff¨s office.? According to the report, Georgia State Patrol performed a pit maneuver on his black 2008 Hyundai Tucson and took him into custody along GA 401.  While waiting to be escorted to a cell, Long asked if he was going to be there for the rest of his life, the report said. He was placed in a padded cell on suicide watch. The report indicated that the conversation with Long was caught on body worn camera.?CNN has requested the video from the Crisp County Sheriff¨s Office. Former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao weighed in for the first time Thursday after a gunman shot and killed eight people in Atlanta, including six who were Asian, saying the work to combat the rise in hate against the Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) community ""must intensify."" ""My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of the attack in Atlanta,"" Chao, who is Asian American, said in a statement first provided to CNN.? ""Such vicious, unconscionable acts of violence cut at the very core of our country and the values on which it was founded. As we await the findings of a thorough investigation, the critical work to combat the haunting rise of hatred against the AAPI community must intensify with the immediacy this latest tragedy commands."" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Chao's husband, also released a statement on the shootings. ＾Committing a crime against anyone because of his or her national origin or race is deeply wrong and antithetical to our founding principles. Asian Americans should not have to experience discrimination anywhere,"" he said. Earlier in the day, McConnell had ignored multiple questions about the Atlanta shootings, including whether former President Trump's harsh rhetoric about China and coronavirus led to a rise in anti-Asian American bias and who is to blame for the shootings. While investigators have not yet determined a motive, violence against Asian Americans has risen since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The group Stop AAPI Hate began tracking violence and harassment against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in March 2020 and has received nearly 4,000 firsthand complaints. Some context: CNN reported earlier that most Senate Republicans have not commented publicly on the issue of violence against Asian Americans in the wake of the shooting. President Biden plans to visit the state Friday with Vice President Kamala Harris and will meet with local Asian-American community leaders. Captain Jay Baker is no longer the spokesperson for the Cherokee County Sheriff¨s Office¨s case investigating the spa shooting, the sheriff¨s office confirmed to CNN. In an earlier statement, Sheriff Frank Reynolds responded to comments made by Baker during a news conference on Tuesday that where he said about the spa shooting suspect, ＾He was pretty much fed up and had been kind of at the end of his rope. Yesterday was a really bad day for him, and this is what he did.￣? Reynolds said in a statement on Thursday that he has known and worked with Baker for many years and his comments ＾were not intended disrespect any of the victims, the gravity of this tragedy or express empathy or sympathy for the suspect.￣? CNN has reached out to Baker for comment. Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Charles Hampton said the investigation into the four people killed at the two Atlanta spas is ongoing and the department is not prepared to release the names of the victims because they are still pursuing the next of kin notifications. ""We had four Asian females that?were killed, and so we are?looking at everything to make?sure we discover and determine?what the motive of our homicides?were,"" Hampton said during a news conference Thursday afternoon.  ""Again, it's just very important?to let you know that we are not?done.?In most cases of homicides we?don't have a quick apprehension,?there's usually a lengthy?investigation especially when it?involves multiple victims, and?we are working diligently to?ascertain all the facts so we?can have a successful?prosecution, and that's what is?most important now."" Hampton said the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, ""may?have frequented those locations"" before Tuesday's shootings. Eight people were shot dead C including six Asian women C at?three metro Atlanta spas?on Tuesday in attacks that police believe were perpetrated by the same suspect.  The four killed in the shooting near Woodstock were Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, of Acworth; Paul Andre Michels, 54, of Atlanta; Xiaojie Tan, 49, of Kennesaw; and Daoyou Feng, 44. Asked his position on whether Tuesday's shootings were a hate crime, Hampton said: ""I don't have a position.?Like I said, I will only comment?about our investigation.?Again, we're not prepared to?talk a lot about what has been?said because, again, we're not?trying to try the case in?public.?This is, again, it's a tragic C?again, we try to remember that?eight families are impacted by?this."" Watch here: For Delaina Yaun, one of the victims of the fatal Georgia spa shootings, ＾family came first,￣ according to her sister Dana Toole.  ＾She had such a wonderful, happy,?upbeat personality. ´ It's?devastating,￣ Toole told CNN¨s Brianna Keilar.? Yaun was recently married, Toole said, and had an eight-month-old daughter. She and her husband wanted to have some time alone, so they visited a spa for a couple's massage, Toole said.?Her husband made it out safely, but she was fatally shot, according to a?GoFundMe page. Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant said it's still too early to determine a motive in the shootings. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told CNN's David Axelrod, ""We can't ignore the fact that there were Asian women who were ！ seem to have been targeted in these Asian massage parlors.￣ ＾The Asian community was?attacked, and unfortunately, my?sister was in an Asian spa,"" Toole said.?""She was enjoying time.?She was just going to enjoy time?with her husband.?Her husband.?Come on.?Like, it's supposed to be a safe?place.?I don¨t understand.￣  ? ＾She didn't?deserve that.?Nobody deserved it.?These families didn't deserve to?lose their loved ones.?I just hope, I hope there's?justice.?I hope that we can prevent stuff?like this from happening,?because this is uncalled for,￣ she added.? Toole said she¨s been trying to avoid social media and watching the news because she is grieving her sister. She said she doesn¨t want any other families to suffer the same result in the future.? ＾I don't want to get?that phone call that I just lost?somebody again like this.?´ She was too young.?She was only 33,￣ Toole said.? Several Asian American female lawmakers, including Reps. Grace Meng, Doris Matsui, Judy Chu, Young Kim and Michelle Steel and Sen. Tammy Duckworth, testified before a House committee today about the discrimination and violence the community has faced. ""Our community is bleeding. We've been in pain and we've been screaming out for help,"" Meng told lawmakers.  Chu, who chairs the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, testified that the ""Asian American community has reached a crisis point that cannot be ignored."" ""What started out last January as just dirty looks and verbal assault have escalated to physical attacks and violence against innocent Asian Americans,"" she added. Some of the Democratic lawmakers on the panel contributed the rise in attacks to the rhetoric former President Trump and other Republican lawmakers used in referring to Covid-19. Reports of anti-Asian hate incidents have risen in recent months, including several?unprovoked violent attacks on elderly Asian Americans, with at least three in the Bay Area captured in disturbing videos this year. The hearing also came after a?string of shootings in the Atlanta area?left eight people dead ！ six of whom were of Asian women. The witnesses implored Republicans to tone down their rhetoric in the?wake of attacks on the Asian American community, with Rep. Meng accusing a Republican of placing a ""bulls-eye"" on them with his comments about China. ""Your president and your party and your colleagues can talk about issues with any other country that you want, but you don't have to do it by putting a bull's-eye on the back of Asian Americans across this country, on our grandparents, on our kids,"" Meng said to Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas. ""This hearing was to address the hurt and pain of our community and to find solutions, and we will not let you take our voice from us,"" she added. Earlier Thursday during the hearing, Roy said his ""concern about this hearing is that it seems to want to venture into the policing of rhetoric in a free society, free speech, and away from the rule of law and taking out bad guys."" ""I think the Chinese Communist Party running the country of China, I think they're the bad guys,"" he said. Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu, who is an immigrant from Taiwan who served active duty in the US Air Force, also pushed back against Roy's remarks, saying the hearing is ""not about policing speech."" ""I served in active duty so you can say whatever you want under the First Amendment, you can say racist stupid stuff if you want,"" Lieu said in comments Thursday. ""But I'm asking you to please stop using racist terms like 'Kung flu,' or 'Wuhan virus' or other ethnic identifiers in describing this virus. I am not a virus and when you say things like that, it hurts the Asian American community."" Thursday's House committee hearing also addressed the history of racism and xenophobia against Asian Americans, which dates back to the 19th century. It was the first House hearing on discrimination against Asian Americans in over three decades.  Watch a moment from the hearing:  Violence against Asian Americans has been on the rise since the pandemic began, but the community has long faced discrimination in the United States, going back all the way to mid-19th century, when the first Chinese migrants arrived in the country. Discrimination by law The?Page Act of 1875 was enacted seemingly to restrict prostitution and forced labor. But many scholars have argued that in reality, it was used?systematically to prevent Chinese women from immigrating to the US, under the pretense that they were prostitutes. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 banned Chinese workers from coming to the US. To support their families back home and to repay loans they took to migrate to the US, Chinese workers were often forced to work for whatever wages they were offered. ＾Many of the non-Chinese workers in the United States came to resent the Chinese laborers, who might squeeze them out of their jobs,￣ according to the Office of the Historian with the US State Department.? The immigration Act of 1924 excluded from entry anyone born in a geographically defined ＾Asiatic Barred Zone,"" except for Japanese and Filipinos. In 1907, the Japanese government had voluntarily limited Japanese immigration to the US and the Philippines was a US colony, so its citizens were American nationals. In the wake of the Pearl Harbor bombing and by an executive order signed by President Franklin Roosevelt, almost all Japanese Americans had to leave their homes and live in camps against their constitutional rights. These immigrants were painted as disloyal and it was considered an issue of public safety.? Anti-Asian attacks and riots In 1871, Los Angeles witnessed the Chinese massacre, where about 500 rioters killed 18 people or 10% of the city¨s Chinese population,?according to the L.A. Public Library. Eight people were convicted of manslaughter, but the convictions were overturned and no one was retried. The anti-Asian sentiments continued amid a hard economic period. In 1885, a disturbing trend of forced evacuation emerged in Tacoma, Washington, where a mob of about 300 people drove about 700 Chinese people out of their homes and forced them into wagons. When they heard about the violence, 150 Chinese people fled neighboring Seattle. In 1886, 350 Chinese were forced out of their homes and most were shipped to San Francisco. A series of anti-Filipino riots took place in 1929 and 1930 in farming communities across California. For example, a mob of about 500 White people roamed Watsonville, California, attacking Filipino farmworkers and their property after Filipino men were considered to not only be taking jobs, but also flaunting social norms by dating White girls. In the 1980s, a Chinese American named Vincent Chen was mistaken as Japanese and beaten to death by two White men who blamed Japan for the loss of auto jobs. And since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic,?many Asian Americans?have been coughed on, spat on, harassed and attacked. The Atlanta shootings have only highlighted that the community is on edge with their long-lived fears and trauma that goes back centuries. CNN's Harmeet Kaur contributed to this report. Avlon: Asian-American discrimination is a horrific chapter of our history? Atlanta Police are holding a 3 p.m. ET news conference with an update on the spa shootings. Eight people, including six Asian women, were shot dead at?three metro Atlanta spas?on Tuesday in attacks that police believe were perpetrated by the same suspect.  Police said yesterday it was too early to determine a motive in the killings, but the attacks come as Asian Americans are facing increased?incidents of hate?in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The suspect told police he believed he had a sex addiction, Cherokee County sheriff's Capt. Jay Baker said at Wednesday's news conference. The defense attorney for spa shooting suspect Robert Aaron Long issued a statement Thursday saying J. Daran Burns has been appointed by the Cherokee County Office of Indigent Defense to represent Long.?? ＾Our condolences are with the victims and their families.?We are working on behalf of our client, Robert Aaron Long, to investigate the facts and?circumstances surround this incident,￣ the statement said.? According to the statement, Burns met with Long at the Cherokee County Adult Detention Center Wednesday and ＾under advisement of counsel, waived his statutory right to a First Appearance Hearing.￣ CNN previously reported that Long¨s scheduled court appearance was canceled at the request of his attorney.?The reason remains unclear. The political portion of President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris¨ trip to Atlanta has been postponed after Tuesday¨s shootings. Instead, the President and vice president will be meeting with Asian American leaders and visiting the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to the White House. In a news release issued moments ago, the White House said: ""Given the tragedy in Georgia on Tuesday night, President Biden and Vice President Harris will postpone the evening political event in Georgia for a future date. During their trip to Atlanta, they will instead meet with Asian-American leaders to discuss the ongoing attacks and threats against the community, meet with other local leaders, and also visit the Centers for Disease Control to receive an update from the team of health and medical experts helping lead the fight against the pandemic."" President Biden has announced a proclamation ordering flags to be flown at half-staff to honor the victims of the Atlanta area shooting. Per the proclamation, flags will be flown at half-staff at the White House and other federal buildings and on military bases, as well as embassies and other facilities abroad, until sunset on March 22 ＾as a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on March 16, 2021, in the Atlanta Metropolitan area.￣ Eight people were shot dead at three metro Atlanta spas on Tuesday. Six were Asian women. Police have not yet offered a motive in the bloody attacks, but because of many of the victims' backgrounds, some public officials and organizations have raised concerns that ethnicity came into play. It comes amid an alarming spike in violence directed at the Asian American community in recent months. A photo?allegedly posted by Captain Jay Baker, a public information officer at the Cherokee County, Georgia, Sheriff¨s Office, show shirts with a racist and anti-Asian message about Covid-19. ＾Covid 19 imported virus from Chy-na,￣ the racist shirt in the photo?posted?April 2, 2020, reads. Although the account that posted it has been deleted, CNN was able to access the photos through a cached copy.?The name on the?Facebook?account matches Jay Baker, and it claims that the individual is an employee of the Cherokee County Sheriff¨s office. The Daily Beast was first to report on the racist shirt photo.?They also reported the account posted photos of Baker in uniform, with his name tag visible.? When contacted by CNN about the post, Baker told CNN, ＾No additional comment.￣?? ＾Love my shirt,￣ the photo caption of the shirt reads.?It goes onto encourage others to buy their own shirts saying, ＾get yours while they last.￣?CNN reached out to the store selling the shirts, but did not immediately receive a response. CNN reached out to Facebook to see whether they deleted the account, or if it was the user that did, but did not receive a response. This allegation comes as criticism over Baker¨s description of spa shooting suspect Robert Aaron Long¨s?actions on Tuesday continues to grow.?? ＾He was pretty much fed up and had been kind of at the end of his rope,￣ Baker said during a news conference on Wednesday. ＾Yesterday was a really bad day for him, and this is what he did.￣ Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday strongly condemned attacks on Asian Americans and said the ＾fear￣ and ＾threat of violence￣ against their community ＾should be a topic of national conversation.￣ ＾We cannot allow the rising tide of bigotry against them, the intolerance against them, the prejudice against them, to go unchecked because in a multicultural society like ours, an attack on any one group is an attack on everyone,￣ he said. For the second day in a row on the Senate floor, Schumer addressed the shootings in the Atlanta-area earlier this week that left eight dead, including six women of Asian descent.  He reiterated that while we don¨t know what drove the shooter to do this ＾despicable￣ crime, ＾there is no doubt that abuse prejudice and violence against Asian Americans is on the rise.￣ Schumer called out former President Trump specifically for his xenophobic rhetoric, and for not condemning bigotry ＾in the instances where he should￣ allowing the floodgates to open bringing hatred ＾far more up to the surface.￣ ＾Unfortunately, the past few years has shown us that America has not excised the age old demon of racism and for too many it has become acceptable, permissible to just shrug your shoulders,￣ he said. ＾That cannot be. With respect to the Asian American community specifically and all communities. We must condemn rhetoric that is racist. In this case, we must condemn any rhetoric that blames the Chinese people for the coronavirus. President Trump did that despicably. And that notion was too often encouraged by others who repeated his harsh nasty and bigoted words.￣ Hear Sen. Schumer's full remarks: A House Judiciary Committee panel is holding a hearing now about discrimination and violence against Asian Americans in the US, which has been on the?rise since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Reports of anti-Asian hate incidents have risen in recent months, including several?unprovoked violent attacks on elderly Asian Americans, with at least three in the Bay Area captured in disturbing videos this year. The hearing also also comes after a?string of shootings in the Atlanta area?left eight people dead ！ six of whom were of Asian women. Though the motive of the killer is still being investigated, the killings have?exacerbated existing fears?among the Asian American community. The House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties will hear from four Asian American female lawmakers:  Sen. Tammy Duckworth 
Rep. Doris Matsui
Rep. Judy Chu 
Rep. Grace Meng Other panel witnesses include actor Daniel Dae Kim, University of Minnesota professor Erika Lee, and Asian Americans Advancing Justice president John C. Yang. Georgia Rep. Bee Nguyen said at least two of the women who were shot and killed on Tuesday lived and worked in the spas. ＾This one fact alone highlights the vulnerability, the invisibility, and the isolation of working-class Asian women in our country,￣ Nguyen said during a Thursday news conference. ＾And we know that vulnerability makes them targets.￣? ＾When they go missing, or when they die, the loss of their lives will not incite the same kind of rage, and they won't even be treated with the same humanity,￣ she said. ＾And in this case, they've been characterized as a problem that needed to be eliminated,￣ she said.? On Tuesday, authorities say Robert Aaron Long, 21, shot and killed eight people at three different spa locations around the metro Atlanta area. He faces eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault. Nguyen said, ＾it's not a coincidence that some of the names have not been released,￣ she said.?＾They're still trying to locate and notify family members of their deaths.￣? ＾Can you imagine living in a spa being between the ages of 50 and 70 years old, and getting gunned down, and we're having trouble getting in touch with some of the family members?￣ she asked.? Nguyen said the hate crime law Georgia passed is a good start, but there is more that still needs to be done.?? ＾Hate crimes laws are not preventative, they are used in the aftermath, as a prosecutorial tool and hate crimes law does not prevent hate killing,￣ she said. President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will meet with Asian American leaders during their visit to Atlanta on Friday. The meeting comes after the shooting deaths of eight people, six of whom were Asian women. A spokesperson for Harris, Sabrina Singh, confirmed the meeting on Twitter, and said the President and Vice President will ＾offer support.￣? The pre-planned Atlanta?stop on the ＾Help is Here￣ Tour is taking on added significance in the wake of a horrific shooting that has sparked a national conversation on racism against Asian Americans amid a spike in violent hate crimes and a deep sense of fear in the Asian American community. ? A Georgia official yesterday said the Atlanta-area spas shooting suspect had a ＾really bad day,￣?which New Jersey Democratic Rep. Andy Kim slammed as detached from reality. ＾That sounds so detached from?what actually happened and what?we should be talking about as a?nation.?And that gentleman is supposed?to be a spokesperson for the?community, spokesperson for our laws and?our rule of law in this country.?Instead, he sounds more like a?spokesperson for the killer,￣ Kim said to CNN¨s Erica Hill.? ＾This is something where we?should not be trying to...downplay what happened.?We should be speaking about it?with the rawness of which it is,?which is a mass murder that?occurred, killing innocent?people, people who should be?with their families right now?and be able to enjoy their?lives.?It really breaks my heart to?hear that kind of callousness?with words that were chosen,?again, from someone who is?supposed to be a spokesperson?for the community and for the?people,￣ Kim added.? Kim said he spoke last night with his wife and called this moment particularly painful for her. ＾This moment means something more?to her and other Asian American?women around the country, and we?need to be very aware of that?and be present for them in?recognizing that trauma,￣ he said.? Kim said he has not heard from lawmakers across the aisle concerning his safety or his family¨s well-being amid a rise in hate crimes directed toward Asian Americans this year. Last fall, the House passed a resolution condemning anti-Asian sentiment, with 14 Republicans joining their Democratic colleagues. ""I hope that if anything?comes out of the tragedy of the?last few days, I hope people see?this was not about politics.?This was not some tactic that?the Democrats or others are?trying to use to jab at the?former president or someone?else.?This is about our lives.?This is about the safety of our?communities.?This is about eight people who?were just killed.?This is about countless others?who have experienced?discrimination,"" Kim said.  Watch the full interview: Six of the eight people who were shot dead at?three metro Atlanta massage parlors?on Tuesday were Asian women. While police have not yet offered a motive in the bloody attacks, but the shootings come against a backdrop of an?increase in violence against Asian Americans nationwide. If you've experienced anti-Asian racism during the pandemic, we want to hear from you. Share your story in the form below:  While investigators said it's too early to say if the Atlanta shootings were racially motivated, experts and activists argue it's no coincidence that six of the eight victims were Asian women. The suspect's claim of a potential sex addiction, they say, is rooted in a history of misogyny and stereotypes that are all too familiar for Asian and Asian American women. They're fetishized and hypersexualized. They're seen as docile and submissive. On top of that, they're often working in the service sector and are?subject to the same racism that affects Asian Americans?more broadly. The way their race intersects with their gender makes Asian and Asian American women uniquely vulnerable to violence, said Sung Yeon Choimorrow, executive director of the non-profit advocacy group National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum. These perceptions are rooted in US history and leave Asian women economically vulnerable too, and this week, those factors came together in a dangerous, and ultimately deadly, way. The perceptions of Asian and Asian American women as submissive, hypersexual and exotic can be traced back centuries. Rachel Kuo, a scholar on race and co-leader of Asian American Feminist Collective, points to legal and political measures throughout the nation's history that have shaped these harmful ideas. One of the earliest examples comes from the?Page Act of 1875, which was enacted seemingly to restrict prostitution and forced labor. But many scholars have argued that in reality, it was used?systematically to prevent Chinese women from immigrating to the US, under the pretense that they were prostitutes. American service members, while abroad for US military activities (including the Philippine-American War, World War II and the Vietnam War), have a history of soliciting sex workers and patronizing industries that encouraged sex trafficking. That furthered?denigrating stereotypes?of Asian women as sexual deviants. Those stereotypes also feed into perceptions of ""Asian women as cheap and disposable workers,"" Rachel Kuo, a scholar on race and co-leader of Asian American Feminist Collective, said. That's made them economically vulnerable, too. Many Asian American women work in service industries, such as beauty salons, hospitality and restaurants, where they are especially at risk since they not only face stigma but are also often migrants, according to Esther Kao, an organizer with Red Canary Song, a New York-based collective of Asian and Asian American advocates for massage parlor workers and sex workers. It's also important to note that not all massage businesses provide sexual services, Kao said. To suggest as much, as the suspect in the Atlanta area attacks did, is a ""racist assumption,"" she said. ""It ties specifically to the fetishization of Asian woman."" Read more here.  CNN's Aditi Sangal contributed to this post.  After eight people ！ six of whom were?Asian women ！were killed at Atlanta-area spas, Georgia State Rep. Bee Nguyen?said the Asian American community is ＾overwhelmed.￣  ＾There is increased fear amongst?our community, but there's also?deep pain and anger.?´ So?often, the centering is around?the perpetrator.?In this case, it is no different.?And so we are trying to focus on?prioritizing the victims and?their family, but we are also?trying to amplify the messaging?that, look, this has been going?on for the past year,￣ Nguyen said on CNN¨s ＾New Day.￣? There¨s been a spike in hate crimes against Asian Americans since the coronavirus pandemic began.  The suspect, Robert Aaron Long, told police he believed he had a sex addiction. Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant said it is still too early to know a motive behind the shootings.? ＾The fact that he's even?characterizing this as?eliminating some sort of sex?addition problem is dehumanizing?and directed at the women who?worked in this industry,￣ Nguyen said.? ""Sex"" is a?hate crime category?under?Georgia law.

And you?simply cannot separate the fact?that there's hypersexualization?of Asian women.?It is interlinked to sex-working?industry, and you cannot separate?the misogyny, the racism and?gender-based violence,￣ Nguyen said.? Eight people, including six Asian women, were shot dead at?three metro Atlanta spas?on Tuesday. Here's what we know about the deadly attacks and the investigation into them. What happened: Eight people were killed and another was wounded in the attacks that police believe were perpetrated by the same suspect. The suspect killed four people at?Young's Asian Massage between the Georgia cities of Woodstock and Acworth. About an hour later and 30 miles away,?another four people were killed at two Atlanta spas across the street from each other.
More attacks possibly thwarted: A 21-year-old suspect, Robert Aaron Long, was taken into custody. When he was apprehended, he was?on his way to Florida ""perhaps to carry out?additional shootings,"" the Atlanta mayor said.
No motive determined yet: Police say it's still too early to determine a motive in the killings, but the attacks come as Asian Americans are facing increased?incidents of hate?in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The suspect told police he believed he had a sex addiction, Cherokee County sheriff's Capt. Jay Baker said at Wednesday's news conference.

Biden should withdraw US troops from Afghanistan. Here's why,18/3/2021,"Those who argue that we need to stay in Afghanistan to thwart attacks against the homeland are wrong. Biden should keep in mind the obvious:  2021 is not 2001. The terrorist threat from Afghanistan has been dramatically reduced in the last 20 years. The departure of US troops is not only possible, but desirable.
The United States and its coalition partners have devastated al Qaeda and crippled its ability to strike across borders. The terrorist group has not been able to carry out a major overseas attack since the bombings in London in 2005. Its leaders have been in hiding for years, although mostly not in Afghanistan, as became clear in the 2011 raid in Pakistan that killed Osama Bin Laden. The Taliban does maintain links to al Qaeda, including through family ties. Yet the several hundred remaining al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan and Pakistan pose a minor threat, especially compared with the group's more dangerous branches in Yemen, Somalia, Syria and the Sahel.
The same goes for the Afghanistan branch of the Islamic State, which has shown no ability to carry out transnational attacks and is under constant military pressure from the Afghan state and the Taliban.
Terrorist groups like al Qaeda can regenerate, of course, but rebuilding in Afghanistan would be difficult, even if the Taliban becomes part of a future government. Since 2001, the United States and its international partners have made slow but substantial progress in developing Afghan institutions, including domestic security forces comprising more than 300,000 members of the army and police.
The Afghan intelligence service and special forces are today among the best in the region and able to operate routinely without US help. And, of course, the United States will always be able to strike terrorist targets in Afghanistan from bases outside the country.
The civil and political landscape of Afghanistan has also evolved. Governing institutions have matured. Women are better integrated into the public and private sector, although much more progress is necessary. Print, broadcast and social media, as well as health care and education have made significant strides.
Yes, Afghanistan remains chronically unstable, with thousands dying each year from the ongoing war, extreme poverty and endemic corruption. Economic and political support from the international community must be sustained to keep the country moving forward. If such international support continues as international troops depart, it's quite unlikely that Afghanistan will revert to a Taliban-ruled harbor for al Qaeda.
The Biden administration surely recognizes that the ongoing talks in Doha between the Afghan government and the Taliban constitute the best opportunity in decades to stabilize the country and end 40 years of war. All forms of US engagement ！ military, political and economic ！ should support these negotiations. Washington has taken an important step in the right direction with its recent call for backstopping the Doha process with a robust set of diplomatic measures, including a UN-sponsored gathering of envoys from China, India, Iran, Pakistan, Russia and the United States.
If the US reneges on its May departure deadline, it would most likely scuttle the Doha negotiations. It makes no sense to jeopardize the best chance for Afghanistan's future by sustaining a US military presence to counter a largely neutralized terrorist threat.
Since 9/11 the United States has decimated al Qaeda, given Afghans an opportunity to determine their own future, honed the ability to strike terrorists anywhere at any time, built a global network of partners to fight terrorism, and significantly enhanced domestic defenses against terrorist attacks. The creation of the Department of Homeland Security and the director of national intelligence has improved coordination and information sharing across the US government and with global partners.  America is a much harder transnational terrorist target than it was on 9/11.
These measures do not guarantee that the nation will never be struck again. But together they provide confidence that the United States is much more secure than  it was in 2001. Americans must remain vigilant against the threat of terrorism, both homegrown and from foreign bases. But such vigilance does not require keeping US troops in Afghanistan.
","As the Biden administration weighs whether to remove all US troops from Afghanistan by May 1 ！ upholding the Trump administration's agreement with the Taliban ！ its discussions should focus on one main concern: preventing future terrorist attacks on the United States or its allies from Afghan territory. Since 9/11, this objective has guided US engagement across four presidencies. Those who argue that we need to stay in Afghanistan to thwart attacks against the homeland are wrong. Biden should keep in mind the obvious:  2021 is not 2001. The terrorist threat from Afghanistan has been dramatically reduced in the last 20 years.

"Former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao calls Atlanta-area shootings 'vicious, unconscionable acts of violence'",18/3/2021,"""My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims of the attack in Atlanta,"" Chao said in a statement first provided to CNN. 
""Such vicious, unconscionable acts of violence cut at the very core of our country and the values on which it was founded. As we await the findings of a thorough investigation, the critical work to combat the haunting rise of hatred against the AAPI community must intensify with the immediacy this latest tragedy commands.""
Tuesday's shootings took place at two spas in Atlanta and another in Acworth, a city northwest of Atlanta, which left eight people -- at least four of them Asian women -- dead.
While investigators have not yet determined a motive in the shootings, violence against Asian Americans has risen since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The group Stop AAPI Hate began tracking violence and harassment against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in March 2020 and has received nearly 4,000 firsthand complaints. 
Most Senate Republicans, however, have not commented publicly on the issue of violence against Asian Americans in the wake of the shootings. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Chao's husband, said in a statement Thursday evening that ""committing a crime against anyone because of his or her national origin or race is deeply wrong and antithetical to our founding principles. Asian Americans should not have to experience discrimination anywhere.""
Earlier in the day, McConnell had ignored multiple questions about the Atlanta shootings, including whether former President Donald Trump's harsh rhetoric about China and coronavirus led to a rise in anti-Asian American bias and about who is to blame for the shootings.
Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday expressed concerns about violence against Asian Americans as they addressed the shootings. The President said in the Oval Office that he was ""very concerned because, as you know, I've been speaking about the brutality against Asian Americans for the last couple of months.""
And Harris, the first person of South Asian descent to hold her office, said the shooting also spoke to the ""larger issue"" of violence.
""Our country, the President and I and all of us, we grieve for the loss,"" she said. ""Our prayers are extended to the families of those who have been killed, and it speaks to a larger issue, which is the issue of violence in our country and what we must do to never tolerate it and to always speak out against it.""

'No one was listening.' Asian business owners react to Atlanta shootings,18/3/2021,"""I saw myself in these women,"" she said. ""I feel I have been screaming about hate crimes and violence against Asian Americans from the beginning of the pandemic, and no one was listening.""
Many Asian-American and Asian business owners like Wills -- who founded the nail salon chain Base Coat Salon -- feel similarly this week in the wake of the shootings. 
Eight people were killed at three metro Atlanta massage parlors. Six of the victims were Asian. Local authorities have said it is too early to know for sure the motive behind the shootings. Nonetheless, they have sparked fresh fears among owners and employees at Asian-owned businesses already grappling with a wave of racism and with hate attacks driven by the pandemic. 
Non-profit coalition Stop AAPI Hate, which has been tracking reports of racism, harassment and discrimination  against Asians, said it received at least 3,795 firsthand complaints since 2020 from all 50 states with at least 503 anti-Asian hate incidents logged between Jan. 1 and Feb. 28 of this year. 
""The alarm has been raised in our community, and it's louder,"" said Charles Yoon, president of the Korean American Association of Greater New York. ""What's happening now is a systemic crisis engendered by xenophobia. Asians are being perceived as 'other' but we are Americans.""
Yoon said he was shocked by the shooting in Atlanta ""because this doesn't appear to be a random attack but targeted at businesses."" 
""It's going to be on the minds of business owners,"" Yoon said. ""If one person can lash out at an Asian business, what's to stop someone else from doing it?""
Asian business owners across industries say they are feeling vulnerable.
James Dong, owner of Last Minute Gear, a San Francisco-based outdoor gear and camping equipment provider, moved his store to a new location two months ago and said the windows have been smashed twice since then.
""There's no way of knowing for sure if this happens because I'm Asian,"" he said, adding that he feels 'lucky' to not personally have been victiminized in this environment.
Nonetheless, Dong said the anti-Asian attacks, especially a fatal incident in January where an 84-year-old San Francisco resident who emigrated from Thailand was violently shoved to the ground, plays heavily on his mind. ""I'm not accepting walk-ins at my store, it's by appointment only or people can shop online,"" he said.
Yong Zhao, CEO and co-founder of Junzi Kitchen, a fast-casual Chinese restaurant chain in New York City, said he's troubled by the indiscriminate attacks against Asians. ""It's disappointing. I'm keeping my daughter in China right now because of this,"" he said.
""Attacks against Asians aren't new. The long-term goal is for all communities to acknowledge that although we are all not the same, we can respect each other and live together,"" said Zhao.
One nail salon owner in Long Island, New York, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she worries about being targeted, fears for her own life and her employees' safety. She is angry that she has to worry.
""I have 18 employees, and I have run my salon for 25 years. I am scared. My husband told me that no matter how long I will live in the United States, I will never be seen as an American because of my Asian face,"" she said. ""I am telling my employees to go home after six. Don't stay out. We came to this country for our freedom. But maybe it's not even better than China now.""
Lisa Fu, executive director of California Healthy Nail Salon Collaborative, an advocacy group for nail salon workers in the state, said her group is in the process of creating a curriculum for its members, who are predominantly of Vietnamese descent, on what to do when they are victims of harassment, hate crimes or violence.
""First, we are training our staff and then will hand out pamphlets and offer Zoom training,"" she said.
Wills said she, too, is doing whatever she can to keep her employees safe at work.
Wills, who closed two salons in California during the pandemic and still operates two in Colorado in addition to 13 locations inside of Nordstrom (JWN) stores, said she now fears for her life and those of her employees, many of whom are Asian.
""I'm keeping my salons open for now because I don't want to show that we're scared,"" she said. But she's also locking the doors after customers enter and exit. ""We used to keep them open for fresh air. Not anymore. It's silly we have to live like this.""

"Traditional cyber protections 'unable to stop' adversaries, cyber agency chief says",18/3/2021,"""Part of the challenge is that you can only secure what you can see,"" he said, testifying before the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Over the past decade, the system of protection has largely relied upon sensors deployed at the perimeters of networks and upon detecting ""known malicious activity,"" Wales added. 
Adversaries have advanced and now move from server to server, mostly located in the United States, designed to ""ensure that we don't know where they're coming from,"" Wales said. ""And our traditional systems, our traditional protection systems are unable to stop them,"" he added.. 
His comments follow two major cyber security incidents in recent months with the SolarWinds breach that compromised nine federal agencies as well dozens of private businesses. On top of that, last week the Biden administration warned Friday that organizations face enormous risks from the recently disclosed Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities that have affected thousands of private organizations.
The US has said Russia was likely behind the SolarWinds breach and CNN has reported the Biden administration is preparing to impose sanctions. Experts have said Chinese hackers were responsbile for the Microsoft Exchange breach but the US has not accused anyone to date.
Wales told lawmakers that the US needs to deploy different types of systems, looking inside of federal networks, not just the perimeter.
The agency is working to advance its efforts on this front with funds provided in the Covid-19 relief bill, which included $650 million for CISA's cybersecurity risk management programs.
For example, Wales said, when CISA wants to know how many SolarWinds devices are on federal networks, CISA has to do a data call. ""CISA does not have access into those,"" he said. 
But agencies are required to report to CISA if there is a cyber incident. 
The federal government is also working to enhance supply chain security for the critical software and products that the federal government purchases, he said. 
""There's just there's a lot of work to do across the board,"" he said. 
Federal agencies still dealing with SolarWinds fallout
During the hearing focused on the SolarWinds supply chain hack, Committee Chairman Sen. Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan, said foreign adversaries, like China and Russia, continue to exploit US cyber vulnerabilities to access confidential and classified information and disrupt government operations.
""Unless our capabilities are able to match the threats we face, American networks and supply chains remain at risk,"" he said.
Wales testified that federal agencies impacted by the SolarWinds breach are continuing to deal with the fallout from the intrusion. 
""The majority of agencies have been progressing in their initial response and remediation work,"" said Wales, when asked about assurances that the SolarWinds malware has been removed from all federal systems.
However, he warned that an ""incident of this significance is going to take time."" 
The computer intrusion campaign linked to Russia hit multiple federal agencies and the private sector, raising concerns about the security of corporate secrets, government emails and other sensitive data. 
""In many cases, agencies are going to want to put in place more, stronger protections and better harden their systems and improve their defenses. And as they do that, over time, you will gain increasing confidence that the adversary no longer has the ability to access. and is no longer present inside of those systems,"" he said. 
Last week, on a call with reporters, a senior administration official outlined several steps the Biden administration plans to take in response to the SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange security incidents, but warned that a direct answer to the SolarWinds hackers is still weeks away.
The nine federal agencies that were compromised by the SolarWinds intrusion have undergone a four-week review with some still reviewing their systems to be sure that the foreign adversaries have been completely evicted, the official said. Those that haven't finished their reviews are expected to be completed by the end of the month.
","Traditional cyber protections used by the federal government are ""are unable to stop"" cyber adversaries, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency acting Director Brandon Wales told lawmakers Thursday. ""Part of the challenge is that you can only secure what you can see,"" he said, testifying before the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Over the past decade, the system of protection has largely relied upon sensors deployed at the perimeters of networks and upon detecting ""known malicious activity,"" Wales added.  Adversaries have advanced and now move from server to server, mostly located in the United States, designed to ""ensure that we don't know where they're coming from,"" Wales said. ""And our traditional systems, our traditional protection systems are unable to stop them,"" he added..  His comments follow two major cyber security incidents in recent months with the SolarWinds breach that compromised nine federal agencies as well dozens of private businesses. On top of that, last week the Biden administration warned Friday that organizations face enormous risks from the recently disclosed Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities that have affected thousands of private organizations. The US has said Russia was likely behind the SolarWinds breach and CNN has reported the Biden administration is preparing to impose sanctions. Experts have said Chinese hackers were responsbile for the Microsoft Exchange breach but the US has not accused anyone to date. Wales told lawmakers that the US needs to deploy different types of systems, looking inside of federal networks, not just the perimeter. The agency is working to advance its efforts on this front with funds provided in the Covid-19 relief bill, which included $650 million for CISA's cybersecurity risk management programs. For example, Wales said, when CISA wants to know how many SolarWinds devices are on federal networks, CISA has to do a data call. ""CISA does not have access into those,"" he said.  But agencies are required to report to CISA if there is a cyber incident.  The federal government is also working to enhance supply chain security for the critical software and products that the federal government purchases, he said.  ""There's just there's a lot of work to do across the board,"" he said.  Federal agencies still dealing with SolarWinds fallout During the hearing focused on the SolarWinds supply chain hack, Committee Chairman Sen. Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan, said foreign adversaries, like China and Russia, continue to exploit US cyber vulnerabilities to access confidential and classified information and disrupt government operations. ""Unless our capabilities are able to match the threats we face, American networks and supply chains remain at risk,"" he said. Wales testified that federal agencies impacted by the SolarWinds breach are continuing to deal with the fallout from the intrusion.  ""The majority of agencies have been progressing in their initial response and remediation work,"" said Wales, when asked about assurances that the SolarWinds malware has been removed from all federal systems. However, he warned that an ""incident of this significance is going to take time.""  The computer intrusion campaign linked to Russia hit multiple federal agencies and the private sector, raising concerns about the security of corporate secrets, government emails and other sensitive data.  ""In many cases, agencies are going to want to put in place more, stronger protections and better harden their systems and improve their defenses. And as they do that, over time, you will gain increasing confidence that the adversary no longer has the ability to access. and is no longer present inside of those systems,"" he said.  Last week, on a call with reporters, a senior administration official outlined several steps the Biden administration plans to take in response to the SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange security incidents, but warned that a direct answer to the SolarWinds hackers is still weeks away. The nine federal agencies that were compromised by the SolarWinds intrusion have undergone a four-week review with some still reviewing their systems to be sure that the foreign adversaries have been completely evicted, the official said. Those that haven't finished their reviews are expected to be completed by the end of the month.",politics,POLITICS
Why anti-Asian American violence is rising -- along with White supremacist propaganda,18/3/2021,"But we do know that hate crimes against Asian Americans have been on the rise since the start of the Covid pandemic in the US.
Asian Americans have reported being targeted at least 500 times in the first two months of this year, according to the organization Stop AAPI Hate with a total of 3,795 complaints received over the past year. The majority of these -- 68% -- were verbal harassment, while 11% involved physical assaults. 
In recent weeks, we've seen the murder of an 87-year-old Thai immigrant Vichar Ratanapakdee as well as the brutal assault of a 67-year old man in San Francisco not named publicly, and the beating of 27-year-old Denny Kim in LA's Koreatown, who says his attackers shouted ""You have the Chinese Virus, go back to China.""
In 2020, there were 29 racially motivated attacks against Asian Americans in New York City, according to the NYPD -- 24 of which are described as having ""coronavirus motivation.""
This rising tide of violence led many minds toward a racial motive after news of the Atlanta-area killings broke. 
It's a fact that the first outbreak of Covid-19 was reported in Wuhan, China. But pandemics don't care about race or politics or even national borders. That doesn't stop racial scapegoating. We saw a variation on the theme during the 1918 influenza epidemic, which some labeled the ""Spanish flu"" -- and which is actually believed to have generated from a US Army base in Kansas -- when immigrants and Native Americans were baselessly blamed for spreading the disease in western US cities. 
That's why there was a pushback on attempts to label this pandemic the China Flu -- or ""Kung-Flu"" -- by President Donald Trump, members of his administration, and allies in right wing media. The point wasn't political correctness run amuck -- it was an awareness of the ugly impulses it could unleash. 
We've seen too many contemporary examples of extreme rhetoric leading to violence. The El Paso shooter -- who killed 22 and wounded 24 others who were shopping at a local Walmart -- told investigators he drove 11 hours so he could target Mexicans, echoing extremist talking points about a ""Hispanic invasion."" 
There's a lot we don't know about the alleged Atlanta spa shooter at this point -- and motivation can be difficult to distill. It should not need to be said that his embrace of God and guns on social media does not signify anything negative in and of itself. Those are both loved by millions of law-abiding Americans. It could turn out that he was motivated by a more personal form of sickness that led him to kill. 
But these impulses rarely incubate in a vacuum -- and we have seen anti-immigrant and anti-Asian sentiments stirred up in our society, especially in recent months. 
According to an analysis by the Anti-Defamation League, anti-Asian American hostility and conspiracy theories spiked 85% on Twitter in the 12 hours after Trump's Covid diagnosis. 
Hate speech has been a growing problem in the USA, with a new report from the ADL showing that white supremacist propaganda nearly doubled in 2020 to the highest levels they've ever recorded. Much of it featured ""White supremacist language with a patriotic slant"" in an effort to ""normalize white supremacist message and bolster recruitment while targeting minority groups."" 
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence released an threat assessment on domestic violent extremism, which Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas described ""greatest threat"" to the US. The report highlights the particular challenges of confronting lone wolf extremists, who Mayorkas described as being ""willing and able to take those ideologies and execute on them in unlawful, illegal, violent ways."" These threats are not new to the US but they are again on the rise.
America is a nation of immigrants. We are the most diverse large nation on earth, which we should count as our greatest renewable resource. Studies show that immigrants are far more likely than native born Americans to start businesses and more than a third of the Nobel Prizes awarded to Americans in the sciences were awarded to immigrants. Asian Americans are not only the fastest growing immigrant group in the US, but they also have higher rates of college degrees and income than the population at large. 
But Asian Americans have also been part of the American tapestry for a long time -- and it's not the first time they have experienced periods of profound discrimination. The Chinese Exclusion Act was a notorious law that codified anti-Asian discrimination back in 1882, making immigration illegal and barring existing Chinese-Americans from becoming citizens. It was repealed in 1943-- at roughly the same time that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt established Japanese-American internment camps. 
This is a horrific side of American history -- but it needs to be remembered so that we do not repeat it. 
Discrimination does not define us as a nation. A decade after the internment camps, America elected its first Asian American Senator, Hiram Fong of Hawaii, the son of Chinese immigrants. He was joined a few years later by Sen. Daniel Inouye, a Japanese American who had fought with the celebrated 442nd Infantry during World War Two and served in the Senate for a half century. 
A fundamental commitment to inclusiveness and equality under the law is the alternate American tradition, fitfully pursued but ultimately making measurable progress over time. As Frederick Douglass declared in a great 1869 speech in which he defended the rights of Asian Americans who were already coming under attack, we are -- at our best -- a ""composite nation."" 
""We are a country of all extremes, ends and opposites; the most conspicuous example of composite nationality in the world,"" Douglass said. ""There are such things in the world as human rights. They rest upon no conventional foundation, but are eternal, universal and indestructible.""  
In the face of prejudice and violence even today, that commitment to equal rights, under law, is all that is required to recognize injustice and demand a different path - consistent with American ideals, not our fears.

US-China talks could end up inflaming trade tensions,18/3/2021,"US Secretary of State Tony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan will head into the two-day meeting with Chinese counterparts Wang Yi and Yang Jiechi in Anchorage, Alaska, carrying a lot of baggage. 
Former President Donald Trump spent much of his term escalating tensions between the world's two largest economies. He sparked a bitter trade war that the two sides have yet to completely unravel. And he punished some of China's most prominent tech companies with crippling sanctions, largely over concerns that they pose a threat to US national security.
For now, it's more likely that other political disputes will dominate the conversation in Anchorage, according to William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who served for 15 years as president of the National Foreign Trade Council. 
The two countries have clashed recently over a number of issues, including Beijing's crackdown on Hong Kong, a former British territory, and allegations of widespread human rights abuses in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang.
China is hoping the Alaska meeting will decouple politics from trade, and eventually lead to a rollback of US tariffs as well as its commitments to buy more US goods. America isn't ready to make concessions.
""I don't think it has sunk in yet the limited flexibility the president has in light of the sharp shift in US public opinion against China and strong demands in Congress from both parties for a hard line on China,"" Reinsch told CNN Business. ""So trade and technology remain issues, but the other issues, particularly human rights, right now are higher on the list.""
Washington may have already ensured that geopolitics will be the focus at the meeting. Earlier this week, the US government sanctioned two dozen Chinese and Hong Kong officials after Beijing further restricted the ability of people in the city to freely elect their leaders. Blinken also criticized China in a meeting with his counterparts in Tokyo on Tuesday, where he accused Beijing of threatening regional stability.
Neither side has indicated that they see Anchorage as a place for meaningful change in their relationship, either. The Biden administration has stressed that the summit is ""a one-off meeting"" that is ""very much intended as an initial discussion."" And Beijing has said it does not have ""high expectations"" for the event. 
""Downplaying hopes for the meeting reflects domestic politics ！ on the US side, Biden wants to avoid appearing to be too soft with Beijing ！ but also the broader state of the relationship,"" wrote Eurasia Group analysts in a research note last week. ""Neither the US nor China is willing to make concessions that the other believes is necessary to meaningfully relax tensions.""
Human rights issues, meanwhile, may actually exacerbate some of the major economic pain points down the road. 
The United States already cited concerns about Xinjiang in decisions last year to curtail imports from that region ！ an attempt to stop goods made with forced labor from entering the US market. (Beijing has long defended its crackdown in Xinjiang as necessary to tackle extremism and terrorism. And contrary to accusations that it forces people there into labor camps, it claims that its facilities are voluntary ""training centers"" where people learn vocational skills, Chinese language and laws.)
""The Biden administration will link human rights issues to exports [and] sales of technology,"" said Alex Capri, a research fellow at Hinrich Foundation and a visiting senior fellow at National University of Singapore. ""Expect to see more export controls and sanctions against Chinese interests.""
Capri and others also say the United States will continue to do what it can to disentangle parts of its economy from China. He pointed to recent efforts from Biden to review US supply chains ！ a move widely seen as a bid to ensure that critical products and supplies are not beholden to Beijing.
""Biden's 'Build Back Better' platform is actually a more coherent version of [Make America Great Again], when it comes to reshoring and ring-fencing strategic industries,"" Capri told CNN Business, pointing to potential efforts to remove China from pharmaceutical, semiconductor, battery, rare earth and artificial intelligence supply chains as ""just the beginning.""
Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the location of Xinjiang within China.

Why hate crime data can't capture the true scope of anti-Asian violence,18/3/2021,"Police have said it is too early to know the shooter's motive, but the attacks come at a time of increased reports of anti-Asian racism and communities sounding the alarm about a wave of violent incidents. The true scope of the problem, though, is difficult to quantify because of poor data collection and low rates of reporting.
In January, President Joe Biden acknowledged the difficulties in reporting on these statistics, signing a memorandum condemning the rise in attacks towards the Asian community and asking the attorney general to ""expand collection of data and public reporting regarding hate incidents against such individuals.""
Hate crime and bias incident data released by police departments and federal agencies is just a fraction of actual incidents, and deficiencies in hate-crime reporting have led organizers and activists to take it upon themselves to collect data on their own. Even then, the definitions of hate crime may differ, leaving policymakers with competing datasets that don't capture the scope of the problem. 
Hate crime data is unreliable and underreported
The Justice Department and FBI are required by a 1990 federal law called the Hate Crime Statistics Act to publish an annual report on hate crime statistics. The annual report serves as the most comprehensive look at hate crime across the country.
These statistics are likely a vast undercount because law enforcement agencies are not required to submit their data to the FBI for their annual crime report. There are more than 18,000 agencies in the United States and more than 3,000 did not submit their crime statistics in 2019. Of the almost 16,000 agencies that did submit data, about 1 in 7 reported any instances of a hate crime. 
""Some of those reports are probably true zeroes, but it's really unlikely that all of those jurisdictions had zero hate crimes,"" said Brendan Lantz, a criminology professor at Florida State University who researches hate and bias crimes. 
Without dedicated resources, law enforcement agencies might not be trained to spot and report hate crimes accurately, creating the impression that hate crimes may be occurring with far less frequency than is accurate.
The FBI's data may also be incomplete because in some jurisdictions, local prosecutors, not police, decide what is charged as a hate crime. The federal government does not collect hate crime statistics from local prosecutors or courts.
However, major cities have reported a troubling rise in racist crimes targeting the Asian community. 
The New York Police Department reported 28 arrests for hate crimes targeting Asians in 2020, up from three in 2019 and two in 2018. The Los Angeles Police Department also reported an increase: 15 anti-Asian hate crimes were reported in 2020, up from seven in 2019 and 11 in 2018.
Some activists and officials have attributed the rise in anti-Asian bias incidents and hate crimes to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which originated in China, as well as to inflammatory rhetoric by former President Donald Trump, who repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as ""the China virus.""
""Hate crimes reflect power dynamics within a society,"" said Lantz. ""If former President Donald Trump can legitimize bias through his own rhetoric, then people feel as if their bigotry and hate crimes are condoned.""
Victims of hate crimes are often unlikely to report to the police
Longstanding distrust of law enforcement, language barriers and immigration status are all deterrents from reporting a crime. 
""A lot of our community members don't know they can report, or they are afraid to report to law enforcement,"" said Quyen Dinh, executive director of Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, a community advocacy group and civil rights organization. ""They would rather share with the community groups they feel comfortable with.""
Sometimes, a victim may not even realize that what they've experienced is a hate crime.
""The bias behind the crime creates another layer,"" Lantz said. ""(Victims) have to ask themselves, 'Is this a crime?' But then they have an added burden of 'was this a crime motivated by bias, or did I read too much into it?'"" 
Lantz estimates that less than half of all hate crimes are ever reported to the police, and because prosecutors must prove that hate crimes are motivated by bias or prejudice, even fewer are charged in court.
This hesitancy points to a need for law enforcement and city agencies to encourage better reporting and for police departments to form stronger relationships with the communities they serve. New York City's ""Stop Asian Hate"" website publishes a toolkit for people who experience discrimination or harassment and is translated into more than 20 languages.
The NYPD created an Asian Hate Crime Task Force last summer, which is composed of 25 detectives of Asian descent in hopes of encouraging victims to report crimes to the police while building a better rapport with the community. 
""The data is critically important,"" said Deborah Lauter, executive director of New York City's Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes. ""Even when we admit it's not a pure system, it sure gives us a good baseline to figure out where the problems are.""
Lack of data creates problems outside the coasts
Not all communities have the same resources as New York or Los Angeles, creating a lopsided view of where crimes occur. Larger cities are more likely to have advocacy groups or more robust resources for victims who are hesitant to report to police. 
""People are more likely to share with a community group than with law enforcement. So how do you handle that when there may not be community groups throughout the country?"" said Aarti Kohli, executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice. 
""The government is not actually set up with alternatives to law enforcement, which is what we really need to get at systemic racism in this country,"" Kohli said.
In smaller cities or rural areas, that lack of resources can create a challenging feedback loop: When hate crimes are underreported, it becomes harder for advocates and civic leaders to make the case for more resources to address hate crimes.
Existing data presents Asians as a monolith
Another challenge in collecting hate crime data is how some groups, like Asians and Latinos, are categorized as a monolithic group instead of a vast diaspora of ethnicities whose needs often differ from one another. Law enforcement agencies often aggregate reports by ethnicity, lumping incidents into broader racial categories. 
According to a 2016 study by the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a non-profit research organization focused on economic growth, more than 17 million members of nearly 50 different races and ethnicities are classified under the umbrella term of ""Asian American or Pacific Islander."" Income and education levels vary widely across these communities, many of which are below the national average. 
""Using disaggregated data can also help policymakers develop substantial quantitative stories about the challenges these communities face as they continue to become a larger part of the broad US social fabric,"" wrote Christian Edlagan and Kavya Vaghul, the study's authors.
Advocacy groups have echoed that sentiment.
""A lot of the lack of data has perpetuated the Asian 'model minority' myth, which is that all Asian Americans are doing better than all other communities of color, and not having that disaggregated data helps to paint that picture,"" said Dinh, the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center director.
Community organizations try to fill in the gaps
To address this lack of reporting, many organizations have taken matters into their own hands, creating spaces for victims of hate and bias incidents to self-report to these groups. 
Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of community organizers and academics that formed last March and reports on instances of racism and discrimination against Asian Americans, said it has received roughly 3,800 reports of anti-Asian discrimination or harassment in the past year. The group aims to ""serve as the leading aggregator of anti-Asian hate incidents,"" according to its website. 
Stop AAPI Hate said it doesn't independently verify any of the reports it receives, but that its total number of incidents only includes reports that come with a description.

""Stop AAPI Hate just reports what it receives. It does tend to believe the impacted person, especially as so many are willing to go on record and to speak publicly about what happened to them,"" Ujala Sehgal, a spokeswoman for Stop AAPI Hate, told CNN.
About two-thirds of all incidents were cases of verbal harassment, while shunning or avoidance made up about 21%. About 11% of the incidents involved physical assaults, according to the group's most recent report. The majority of respondents were women. Because the data is crowdsourced and self-reported, these percentages may still not be representative of the full scope of harassment toward the Asian community.
Most of these attacks ！ including verbal threats or discrimination ！ may not meet the threshold for a hate crime charge. But these events can still create trauma and fear in communities that feel they are being targeted. 
In aggregating these incidents themselves, organizers are highlighting the gaps in government-level data collection and stressing an urgent need for long-term solutions. 
""The undercount is seen as 'no need' as opposed to lack of access or need,"" Dinh said. ""This has been a really systemic challenge our communities continue to face. We always have to do double the work of really explaining why our communities matter."" 
This story has been updated with a new statement from Stop AAPI Hate's spokeswoman to clarify the subject of her previous statement.
","There has been a marked rise in anti-Asian violence across the United States, an issue that once again rattled a community on edge after the Tuesday mass shooting deaths of eight people at spas in the Atlanta area, six of whom were Asian women.  Police have said it is too early to know the shooter's motive, but the attacks come at a time of increased reports of anti-Asian racism and communities sounding the alarm about a wave of violent incidents.

The Los Angeles Police Department also reported an increase: 15 anti-Asian hate crimes were reported in 2020, up from seven in 2019 and 11 in 2018. Some activists and officials have attributed the rise in anti-Asian bias incidents and hate crimes to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which originated in China, as well as to inflammatory rhetoric by former President Donald Trump, who repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as ""the China virus."" ""Hate crimes reflect power dynamics within a society,"" said Lantz. ""If former President Donald Trump can legitimize bias through his own rhetoric, then people feel as if their bigotry and hate crimes are condoned."" Victims of hate crimes are often unlikely to report to the police Longstanding distrust of law enforcement, language barriers and immigration status are all deterrents from reporting a crime.  ""A lot of our community members don't know they can report, or they are afraid to report to law enforcement,"" said Quyen Dinh, executive director of Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, a community advocacy group and civil rights organization. ""They would rather share with the community groups they feel comfortable with."" Sometimes, a victim may not even realize that what they've experienced is a hate crime. ""The bias behind the crime creates another layer,"" Lantz said. ""(Victims) have to ask themselves, 'Is this a crime?' But then they have an added burden of 'was this a crime motivated by bias, or did I read too much into it?'""  Lantz estimates that less than half of all hate crimes are ever reported to the police, and because prosecutors must prove that hate crimes are motivated by bias or prejudice, even fewer are charged in court. This hesitancy points to a need for law enforcement and city agencies to encourage better reporting and for police departments to form stronger relationships with the communities they serve. New York City's ""Stop Asian Hate"" website publishes a toolkit for people who experience discrimination or harassment and is translated into more than 20 languages. The NYPD created an Asian Hate Crime Task Force last summer, which is composed of 25 detectives of Asian descent in hopes of encouraging victims to report crimes to the police while building a better rapport with the community.  ""The data is critically important,"" said Deborah Lauter, executive director of New York City's Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes. ""Even when we admit it's not a pure system, it sure gives us a good baseline to figure out where the problems are."" Lack of data creates problems outside the coasts Not all communities have the same resources as New York or Los Angeles, creating a lopsided view of where crimes occur. Larger cities are more likely to have advocacy groups or more robust resources for victims who are hesitant to report to police.  ""People are more likely to share with a community group than with law enforcement. So how do you handle that when there may not be community groups throughout the country?"" said Aarti Kohli, executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice.  ""The government is not actually set up with alternatives to law enforcement, which is what we really need to get at systemic racism in this country,"" Kohli said. In smaller cities or rural areas, that lack of resources can create a challenging feedback loop: When hate crimes are underreported, it becomes harder for advocates and civic leaders to make the case for more resources to address hate crimes. Existing data presents Asians as a monolith Another challenge in collecting hate crime data is how some groups, like Asians and Latinos, are categorized as a monolithic group instead of a vast diaspora of ethnicities whose needs often differ from one another. Law enforcement agencies often aggregate reports by ethnicity, lumping incidents into broader racial categories.  According to a 2016 study by the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a non-profit research organization focused on economic growth, more than 17 million members of nearly 50 different races and ethnicities are classified under the umbrella term of ""Asian American or Pacific Islander."" Income and education levels vary widely across these communities, many of which are below the national average.  ""Using disaggregated data can also help policymakers develop substantial quantitative stories about the challenges these communities face as they continue to become a larger part of the broad US social fabric,"" wrote Christian Edlagan and Kavya Vaghul, the study's authors. Advocacy groups have echoed that sentiment. ""A lot of the lack of data has perpetuated the Asian 'model minority' myth, which is that all Asian Americans are doing better than all other communities of color, and not having that disaggregated data helps to paint that picture,"" said Dinh, the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center director. Community organizations try to fill in the gaps To address this lack of reporting, many organizations have taken matters into their own hands, creating spaces for victims of hate and bias incidents to self-report to these groups.  Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of community organizers and academics that formed last March and reports on instances of racism and discrimination against Asian Americans, said it has received roughly 3,800 reports of anti-Asian discrimination or harassment in the past year. The group aims to ""serve as the leading aggregator of anti-Asian hate incidents,"" according to its website.  Stop AAPI Hate said it doesn't independently verify any of the reports it receives, but that its total number of incidents only includes reports that come with a description. ""Stop AAPI Hate just reports what it receives. It does tend to believe the impacted person, especially as so many are willing to go on record and to speak publicly about what happened to them,"" Ujala Sehgal, a spokeswoman for Stop AAPI Hate, told CNN. About two-thirds of all incidents were cases of verbal harassment, while shunning or avoidance made up about 21%. About 11% of the incidents involved physical assaults, according to the group's most recent report. The majority of respondents were women. Because the data is crowdsourced and self-reported, these percentages may still not be representative of the full scope of harassment toward the Asian community. Most of these attacks ！ including verbal threats or discrimination ！ may not meet the threshold for a hate crime charge. But these events can still create trauma and fear in communities that feel they are being targeted.  In aggregating these incidents themselves, organizers are highlighting the gaps in government-level data collection and stressing an urgent need for long-term solutions.  ""The undercount is seen as 'no need' as opposed to lack of access or need,"" Dinh said. ""This has been a really systemic challenge our communities continue to face. We always have to do double the work of really explaining why our communities matter.""  This story has been updated with a new statement from Stop AAPI Hate's spokeswoman to clarify the subject of her previous statement.",us,US
Russia reacts angrily after Biden calls Putin a 'killer',18/3/2021,"Putin on Thursday nevertheless invited Biden to hold open online talks in the wake of the remarks. 
In an interview with ABC that aired Wednesday, Biden said Putin ""will pay a price"" for his efforts to undermine the 2020 US election following a landmark American intelligence assessment that found the Russian government meddled in the 2020 election with the aim of ""denigrating"" Biden's candidacy.
When interviewer George Stephanopoulos asked Biden if he thought Putin was ""a killer,"" the President said, ""Mhmm. I do.""
Responding to the comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday that ""there hasn't been anything like this in history.""
He said it was clear that Biden ""definitely does not want to improve relations"" with Russia and that the relationship between the two countries is ""very bad."" When asked how it can affect relations, Peskov said ""it is absolutely clear how,"" but refused to elaborate.
""These are very bad statements by the President of the United States. He definitely does not want to improve relations with us, and we will continue to proceed from this,"" Peskov said.
 
Putin himself responded Thursday saying, ""I would like to offer President Biden [the opportunity] to continue our discussion, but on condition that we'll do so what is called live, online. Without anything pre-recorded, in an open and direct discussion.""
""It seems to me, it would be interesting both for Russian people and for the US people, as well as for many other countries,"" Putin added. 
Russia state media TASS reported Putin has invited Biden to hold the discussion on Friday or Monday. 
White House press secretary Jen Psaki weighed in on the invitation saying she wasn't sure if the call would be something the administration would entertain.
""I'll have to get back to you if that is something we're entertaining. I would say that the President already had a conversation already with President Putin, even as there are more world leaders that he has not yet engaged with,"" Psaki said during a press briefing. And we engage with Russian leaders, members of the government, at all levels. But I don't have anything to report to you in terms of a future meeting.""
The Russian leader previously reacted to the comments by wishing Biden ""good health"" at a news conference. 
""It's true, we really know each other personally. What would I answer him? I would tell him: be healthy,"" Putin said. ""I wish him good health. I say this without irony, no jokes. This is first of all.""
""When we evaluate other people, states and nations, we always seem to be looking in the mirror. We always see ourselves. We always pass on to another person what we ourselves are in essence,"" Putin added.
""In childhood, when we argued with each other, we said: 'He who calls names is called that himself.' This is no coincidence, this is not just a childish joke, it has a very deep psychological meaning.""
Psaki said earlier Thursday Biden had no regrets about his comments saying, ""Nope. The President gave a direct answer to a direct question.""
When pressed on whether the ""killer"" language was constructive for the US-Russia relationship, Psaki declined to say.
""President Biden has known President Putin for a long time, they've both been on the global stage for a long time worked through many iterations of a relationship between the United States and Russia. And he believes we can continue to do that,"" she said.
The US, Psaki said, is confident it can work with Russia on areas of ""mutual national interests,"" however, ""The President is not going to hold back, clearly, when he has concerns, whether it is with words or actions.""
When asked if the President's remarks might further escalate tensions with Moscow, Psaki noted that Amb. John Sullivan ""remains in Moscow"" and is ""engaged.""
""We continue to believe that diplomacy is the first step and should always be the first step, should be our objective, as we pursue all relationships -- even with our adversaries,"" she said.
Russia pulled its US ambassador on Wednesday in response to the comments with Peskov revealing the diplomat, Anatoly Antonov, had been ""invited"" back to Moscow to discuss Russia-US relations. 
Peskov said there are currently no plans for Putin to meet with Antonov, but if necessary Putin will have a discussion with him. 
In the interview, Biden also claimed he told Putin in 2011 he didn't think Putin had a soul. Putin's response, Biden recalls, was to say, ""We understand one another.""
""Look, most important thing dealing with foreign leaders, and I've dealt with a lot of them over my career, is just know the other guy,"" Biden told ABC.
The US intelligence community said in its Tuesday report that the Russian government meddled in the 2020 election with an influence campaign ""denigrating"" President Joe Biden and ""supporting"" former President Donald Trump, detailing a massive disinformation push that successfully targeted, and was openly embraced, by Trump's allies.
The report is the most comprehensive assessment of foreign threats to the 2020 elections to date, detailing extensive influence operations by US adversaries that sought to undermine confidence in the democratic process, in addition to targeting specific presidential candidates.
The President wouldn't provide more details to ABC on what ""price"" Putin will pay, but the Biden administration is expected to announce sanctions related to election interference as soon as next week, three US State Department officials have told CNN. The officials did not disclose any details related to the expected sanctions but said they will target multiple countries including Russia, China and Iran.

Biden administration finalizing plans to send millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses to Canada and Mexico,18/3/2021,"""I can confirm that we have 7 million releasable doses available of AstraZeneca,"" Psaki said at Thursday's White House press briefing. ""2.5 million of those, we are working to finalize plans to lend those to Mexico and 1.5 million to Canada,"" she added.
President Joe Biden could announce the agreement upon finalization, which could happen as soon as Friday, CNN has learned. On Tuesday, Mexico's foreign minister said an announcement could come by the end of the week.
""I'd say we've made good progress, but the details, figures, provisions, won't be known until Friday,"" Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard told reporters on Tuesday morning, according to Reuters. ""We requested as many (AstraZeneca doses) as possible.""
Biden has met virtually with both Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Andr└s Manuel L┏pez Obrador. During the conversations, they both pressed him on the need for more vaccines. Mexican government officials also pressed Biden officials on helping with vaccine supply during conversations between both parties regarding the surge on the southern border, an administration official told CNN.
The Biden administration has committed to having enough vaccines for all Americans before sharing doses, and if this agreement comes together it would be the first time the US has shared vaccines directly with another country. It would also likely give a major boost to vaccination efforts in Canada and Mexico who are struggling with their vaccine roll-out in comparison to the US.
On Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed that requests have been received from both Mexico and Canada and said that they are being considered carefully. She provided no details on when a decision would be reached.
The other administration official told CNN that one option under consideration is a swap agreement with the two countries: an agreement to share the AstraZeneca doses now with the condition that Mexico and Canada will share excess vaccines with the US in the future.
There are tens of millions of AstraZeneca doses stockpiled in the US and the company believes it will have roughly 50 million Covid-19 vaccine doses available to the US government by the end of April. None of those doses are available to Americans now because AstraZeneca has not applied to the Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorization, and the vaccine is still going through clinical trials in the US.
AstraZeneca has been approved for use in both Canada and Mexico, and the company itself has asked the Biden administration to consider requests to donate inventory to other nations. 
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador announced Monday that he was close to reaching two agreements on vaccines, but he didn't specify which countries would be sending them. Another top official in Mexico publicly asked the US to share AstraZeneca vaccines earlier this week.  
A Canadian Embassy spokesperson said that there have been ""great engagements"" with the Biden administration about Covid-19 and added that ""conversations are ongoing"" when it comes to getting more Canadians vaccinated. The spokesperson did not comment on the possible swap agreement. 
Tensions over vaccine diplomacy
These conversations come as political leaders in both Mexico and Canada are under increasing pressure to secure vaccines amid a wider global scramble for doses.
The US is now ahead of almost every other country in the world when it comes to vaccinating its population and having secured contracts with vaccine producers. Biden said last week that by May 1 all adults will be able to receive vaccines.
The US has contributed $2 billion in total to a global coronavirus vaccine initiative called COVAX, and has pledged to release an additional $2 billion ""as we work with other donors to elevate pledge commitments."" It has established bilateral agreements with certain countries for vaccine storage efforts, and is working alongside the allies in the Asia-Pacific region to increase production in India.
The Biden administration will eventually share excess vaccines -- beyond the AstraZeneca doses -- and does not see joint efforts alongside US allies as precluding them from unilaterally donating vaccines to other countries down the road, according to the senior administration official.
""We are giving $4 billion to COVAX. But we also know once we get our own country vaccinated, since we have suffered worse than virtually any country besides Brazil -- we are both way up there with over 530,000 deaths -- then we will make any surplus vaccine available to the countries who have not the resources to be able to make it themselves,"" Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday.
Biden made the same commitment last week. 
""If we have a surplus, we're going to share it with the rest of the world,"" Biden said. ""We're going to start off making sure Americans are taken care of first.""
Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said last week that ""until everyone in the world is vaccinated, then no one is really fully safe.""
The Biden administration's decision to focus inward on vaccines, particularly given the dire need globally and the administration's top priority to re-assert US global leadership, is putting the Biden administration in a somewhat awkward position in comparison to a global rivals.
China has taken a different approach to the US and is exporting vaccines widely before making vaccines widely available at home. Russia and India are also sharing vaccines but not on the same scale as Beijing. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced March 3 that it is providing free vaccines to 69 countries and commercially exporting them to 28 more.
Some US allies and partners are worried that China's global effort to ramp up vaccine exports and vaccine production agreements so quickly will make it hard for the US to catch up, diplomats told CNN. 
Mexico has received AstraZeneca shots from India and is also the focus of China's vaccine diplomacy. Mexican media reported March 9 that the country will receive 22 million doses of China's Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines. 
Beijing's push to aggressively export vaccines has been characterized by US officials as an attempt to spread China's influence and soft power. 
When asked on Wednesday if the US will be able to surpass China's efforts on vaccine diplomacy after fulfilling the commitment of vaccinating Americans, Deputy State Department Spokesperson Jalina Porter did not answer the question. 
A State Department spokesperson said that while Biden has made the priority to vaccinate Americans clear he is also ""deeply focused on the issue of expanding global vaccination, manufacturing, and delivery, which will all be critical to end the pandemic.""

Kyoto Protocol Fast Facts,18/3/2021," Facts
192 parties have ratified the protocol (191 states and one regional economic integration organization). The United States has not; it dropped out in 2001.
The protocol mandated that 37 industrialized nations plus the European Community cut their greenhouse gas emissions. Developing nations were asked to voluntarily comply.
More than 100 developing countries, including China and India, were exempted from the treaty.
The treaty could not go into effect until at least 55 countries, accounting for 55% of the world's emissions in 1990, ratified it.
The signatories agreed to cut their country's emissions to 5% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.
The treaty also established an international trading system, which allows countries to earn credits toward their emission target by investing in emission cleanups outside their own country.
According to the Global Carbon Atlas, the largest contributors of greenhouse gases in 2019 were China and the United States.
Timeline
December 1-11, 1997 - The Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is held in Kyoto, Japan. More than 150 nations attend and adopt the first international treaty on controlling and reducing greenhouse gases.
November 2, 1998 - In Buenos Aires 160 nations meet to work out details of the protocol and create the ""Buenos Aires Action Plan.""
July 23, 2001 - Negotiators from 178 countries meet in Bonn, Germany, and agree to adopt the protocol. The United States doesn't participate.

November 18, 2004 - The Russian Federation ratifies the protocol, giving new hope that it can be implemented, even without the United States.
February 16, 2005 - The Kyoto Protocol takes effect.
December 12, 2011 - Canada officially renounces the Kyoto Protocol. Environment Minister Peter Kent says Kyoto's goals are unworkable because the United States and China never agreed to Kyoto, and that a new pact is needed to address emissions.
December 2012 - The Kyoto Protocol is extended to 2020 during a conference in Doha, Qatar.
June 23, 2013 - Afghanistan adopts the Kyoto Protocol, becoming the 192nd participant. 
2015 - At the COP21 sustainable development summit, held in Paris, all UNFCCC participants sign the ""Paris Agreement"" effectively replacing the Kyoto Protocol. The parties agree to limit warming ""well below"" 2 degrees, and below 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels if feasible.

The last blow to Hong Kong's faltering democracy,18/3/2021,"Clues had come in a recent speech by Xia Baolong, the head of the Chinese Communist Party's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office. Xia stressed that all three branches of the Hong Kong government -- executive, legislative, and judicial -- must be run by ""patriots."" He also called for implementing ""patriotism"" in Hong Kong's official requirement for public servants, so that it can be better enforced in the future.
Last week, China's rubber-stamp parliament approved those changes, as expected. (The Hong Kong government is now debating them, though this process is expected to be a formality.)
The NPC didn't change rules surrounding Hong Kong's judiciary, but given that Xia had also mentioned applying a similar ""patriotism"" standard to Hong Kong's judges, we can probably expect Beijing will apply more pressure to Hong Kong's court system, in addition to the electoral changes it just enacted.
Patriotism has long been equated with loyalty to the party in China, where the Chinese Communist Party is propagandized as synonymous with China, the country. To be a patriot in China is to support the party's policy and direction without question; critique of the party is conversely portrayed as betraying the country. 
While this idea of blind patriotism has been fundamentally incorporated into mainland China's society through decades of indoctrination, it is often rejected in Hong Kong, where freedom of speech and freedom of political participation were the norm until recently. Under Chinese President Xi Jinping's rule, the CCP increasingly sees Hong Kong's democratic foundation as a hindrance to its total control of the city. Two important pillars that support this foundation are Hong Kong's partially free elections and its much-lauded judiciary. To ensure complete control of Hong Kong, then, the CCP has now moved to dismantle these democratic mechanisms completely.
Since the 2019 pro-democracy protests, the CCP has sped up the undemocratic reforms in Hong Kong. In the electoral process, though Beijing loyalists have always dominated the Legislative Council, also known as LegCo, there was still space for pro-democracy legislators to influence government policies. At the local level, District Council elections were largely free and fair and saw pro-democracy candidates succeed. However, perhaps surprised by the global success of the protest movement in the past two years, the CCP set its sights on doing away with the entire pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong. 
To set the stage, the CCP rolled out a national security law in record time last year, without consulting the Hong Kong government and in contravention of Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law. (Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has maintained that the Basic Law has not been violated.) Then, in January, the police conducted mass arrests of pro-democracy lawmakers, accusing them of violating the national security law. At the end of February, 47 of the arrested 53 people, many of them lawmakers or activists, were detained upon reporting to police stations and charged with ""conspiracy to commit subversion"" for their participation in an unofficial primary election last year. (Not all remain in detention, as some have been granted bail.) Pro-democracy primaries have been lawfully carried out in Hong Kong in years prior. The bail hearings for the arrested lawmakers are ongoing.
Another pillar of Hong Kong's democratic foundation is its judicial system, put in place by the colonial British government before the handover in 1997. The impartial nature of the judiciary was put on display during the 2019 protests, when a number of principled judges refused to entertain the trumped-up charges of rioting brought by the Hong Kong government against peaceful protesters, as the city saw a mix of orderly and destructive demonstrations. Long accustomed to ""rule by law"" as opposed to ""rule of law,"" the CCP is predictably unimpressed with the independence of the judiciary and its incapability to act as an accomplice in imposing authoritarianism in the city. 
To better control the judicial process, the CCP altered due process via the national security law. Now, those charged under the law are to be tried by a judge handpicked by Hong Kong's Chief Executive, likely allowing the Beijing-loyal executive branch to influence trial outcomes. (In Hong Kong, not all judges are from the city; some are British or Australian.) In Xia's speech, the expectation for Hong Kong's judges is even more clearly outlined -- Xia states that judicial personnel must all be ""true patriots."" 
 As many of the 47 lawmakers sit in detention centers, the CCP has dealt the last blow to Hong Kong's democratic pillars. At this point, it may be inevitable for Hong Kong to suffer a total loss of democracy, but international response to the CCP's actions still matters. Young activists in exile, such as Nathan Law, Sunny Cheung, and Glacier Kwong, have long called for continued attention toward Hong Kong's struggles, and for stronger sanctions from the United States and European Union governments. 
EU leaders and the Biden administration must listen to these calls and respond strongly. They must not let Hong Kong's democracy be destroyed in silence.

Bloomberg and Timmermans: Ending global coal subsidies will save lives,18/3/2021,"If we want to tackle climate change and ensure people's health and well-being, we have to accelerate our move away from coal.
Ending our dependence on coal will save lives. Air pollution ！ to which coal contributes significantly ！ causes 400,000 premature deaths a year in the EU alone, and 5% to 10% of all annual premature deaths in the United States. Coal dependence is also a drag on economic growth and increasingly costly for consumers. In fact, the cost of renewable power continues to fall, and in some regions, solar is one of the cheapest forms of power.
While the phase-out of coal is picking up speed, coal still produces close to 40% of global electricity. And that number could rise further in some countries, since the short-term costs of coal power can still be lower than transitioning to green energy. One important way to shift this dynamic is to end the tax breaks, government investment, overseas aid and subsidies ！ some of which the public is paying ！ that keep coal on life support.
The United States and the European Union can be leaders in this shift. Earlier this year, the EU announced its support for an end to fossil fuel subsidies globally. And the European Investment Bank has already said that it will no longer fund any fossil fuel energy projects after this year, directing all of its work toward clean energy innovation. Today, 15 European countries have committed to completely phasing out coal power, and three have already become coal power-free.
The United States has made big strides as well. In the last decade, 60% of US coal plants have closed, and coal's share of US electricity generation fell from 46% in 2010 to an estimated 20% in 2019. Coal plant closures have continued to accelerate because economics clearly favor clean energy, and the public increasingly demands power sources that don't poison our air and threaten our health. President Biden has also indicated that he intends to end overseas development aid for fossil fuel projects. 
But more can and must be done. 
Other countries, such as China, continue to finance many coal projects overseas. To convince them to stop, the EU and the United States must lead by example. Together, they can provide more support to regions in Africa and Latin America, which would enable countries there to leapfrog over outdated fossil fuel projects and use clean power to bring universal access to electricity instead.
The EU and the United States should also provide more support for communities and regional economies that depend on jobs in fossil fuel industries, in particular coal, and are trying to transition workers into new industries and roles. The EU's Just Transition Fund is working to do that in member states and in coal regions beyond its borders in the Western Balkans and Ukraine. Bloomberg Philanthropies similarly has supported work in coal regions in the EU and in the United States, including job training and providing opportunities in clean energy industries. The more we do to help coal regions, the less communities will suffer, and the more political support there will be to step away from coal toward a thriving green business model.
Making the transition to a green economy will require major new investments, but it will also lead to more new jobs, better health and stronger, more sustainable economic growth. On the other hand, the costs of non-action, often ignored, are much higher: Continued reliance on coal will lead to more toxic pollution, more death and disease, more extinction and biodiversity loss, more economic damage from extreme and unpredictable weather and more lost ground in the fight against the climate crisis. To stop such catastrophic results, and to improve people's health and well-being, it's imperative that the EU and US lead a united front in moving the world beyond coal ！ not for the sake of the planet, but for the sake of humanity.
","The increasing urgency that countries are showing in the fight against climate change is welcome news, but it is bumping up against a hard reality: Much of the world is still using and investing in coal-fired power plants, one of the biggest drivers of greenhouse gas emissions.  If we want to tackle climate change and ensure people's health and well-being, we have to accelerate our move away from coal. Ending our dependence on coal will save lives.

8 killed in shootings at Atlanta-area spas,18/3/2021,,"At least?eight people were found dead?at three different spas in the Atlanta area Tuesday. Police say video evidence led them to believe one suspect, Robert Aaron Long, was responsible for all three shootings. He was?arrested Tuesday night?about 150 miles south of Atlanta. Here's what we know so far: About the shootings: The first shooting happened shortly before 5 p.m. Tuesday at Young's Asian Massage near Woodstock, Georgia, about 30 miles northwest of downtown Atlanta. That shooting left four dead. One person was also wounded, Cherokee County Sheriff's Office said. About an hour later, three people were found dead at the Gold Massage Spa on Piedmont Road in Atlanta, Police Chief Rodney Bryant said. One person was also found dead at the Aroma Therapy Spa, directly across the street. The victims: Of those who died, six were Asian and two were White, Cherokee County sheriff's?officials said?in a joint news conference with Atlanta police on Wednesday. All six Asian victims were women,?the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported?earlier, citing authorities. The four killed in the shooting near Woodstock were Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, of Acworth; Paul Andre Michels, 54, of Atlanta; Xiaojie Tan, 49, of Kennesaw; and Daoyou Feng, 44. The injured survivor was Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, of Acworth, authorities said. Police didn't immediately release the names of the four people killed at the two Atlanta spas. Four of those killed were of Korean ethnicity, according to South Korea's foreign ministry, which said it was in contact with its consulate in Atlanta. The arrest: Cherokee County investigators found surveillance video of a suspect near the first scene and published it on social media. Long's family saw the image and helped authorities identify him, Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said Wednesday. Investigators tracked Long's phone, and Reynolds reached out to authorities in Crisp County, well to the south, to let them know he appeared to be heading in that direction, Reynolds said. Long's vehicle was spotted, a chase ensued on Interstate 75 in Crisp County, and a state trooper performed a maneuver that sent the SUV out of control, authorities said. Police arrested Long and confiscated a 9 mm gun from his vehicle, Cherokee County authorities said. The suspect's intentions: Preliminary information indicates the shootings could relate to the suspect's claim of a potential sex addiction, Cherokee County authorities said Wednesday. Long told investigators he saw the spas as a?temptation that he wanted to eliminate, they said. Still, it was too early to know a motive, Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant said at a joint news conference with Cherokee County sheriff's officials. Long has claimed responsibility for the shootings in Cherokee County and in Atlanta, the Cherokee County sheriff's office said. Long told investigators the killings were not racially motivated, the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office said in a news release. He was being held Wednesday in Cherokee County on four counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault, the sheriff's office said. He is also facing four counts of murder in Atlanta, according to city police. He was headed to Florida: Before he was stopped, Long was headed to Florida ""perhaps to carry out additional shootings,"" Bottoms, the Atlanta mayor,?said Wednesday, citing investigators. ""It's very likely there would have been more victims,"" Bottoms said. Long told investigators he was headed to Florida and was ""going to do more acts"" there, Cherokee County Sheriff's Capt. Jay Baker said Wednesday. Community on edge: Because of the victims' backgrounds, some public officials had?raised fears?before Wednesday's police news conference that ethnicity had come into play, amid rising concerns nationwide about?anti-Asian violence?during the coronavirus pandemic. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, acknowledging most of the victims were Asian,?said Wednesday?that ""we know (violence against Asian Americans) is an issue that's happening around the country; it is unacceptable, it is hateful, and it has to stop."" CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post incorrectly spelled Xiaojie Tan's name. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told CNN¨s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday the man suspected of killing eight people at three Atlanta-area spas should face ＾the stiffest most appropriate charges.￣? During the interview on the ""Situation Room,"" Blitzer asked the mayor whether these killings should be prosecuted as hate crimes, noting Georgia¨s hate crime law does include victims targeted based on sex. ＾I think whatever the stiffest most appropriate charges there are, this guy should face those charges,￣ said Bottoms. ＾In Georgia, you can be charged with a hate crime. It covers a variety of areas and I personally think it would be appropriate, but I will defer to the prosecutors to make that determination.￣ Bottoms said the city is grateful to law enforcement that the suspected shooter, Robert Aaron Long, 21, of Woodstock, Georgia, was apprehended quickly and the violence was not carried out to other states. Although the suspect claims the shootings were not racially motivated, Bottoms said it¨s difficult to ignore that Asian community has been targeted.? ＾This is a man who murdered, eight people in cold blood, so it's very difficult to believe what he says,￣ said Bottoms. ＾It's difficult to ignore the fact that many of the victims were Asian, all of the victims in Atlanta were Asian, in fact, and that he targeted these Asian massage parlors.￣ Bottoms said it is important that people stand in solidarity with the Asian American community at this time. ＾They are being targeted unfairly and in Atlanta, what we've seen the worst has happened,￣ she said. ? The suspect in the spa shootings where eight were killed in metro-Atlanta purchased his gun legally at a local gun store, Big Woods Goods in Holly Springs, Georgia, an attorney for the company confirmed to CNN. In a brief statement to CNN, Matt Kilgo said the company is fully cooperating with law enforcement and there is no indication that there was anything improper with the transfer yesterday. The suspect, Robert Aaron Long, has been charged with four counts of murder and one count of?aggravated assault?in Cherokee County and four counts of murder in Fulton County. Eight people died and one person was injured in the shootings on Tuesday. Long remains in custody in Cherokee County. ? The Atlanta Police Department's Homicide Unit has charged Robert Long, the 21 year-old accused of killing several people in Georgia, with four counts of murder. These are in addition to earlier charges from the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office that include ＾four counts of Murder and one count of Aggravated Assault and has no bond,￣ the CCSO said in a Wednesday statement.  In total, Long faces eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault for the incidents.? He is currently detained at the Cherokee County Adult Detention Center and it is anticipated that he will face a judge tomorrow.  Eight people C including six Asian women C were shot dead at?three metro Atlanta spas Tuesday evening. Police have not yet offered a motive in the shootings saying it's too early in the investigation to determine if they were a hate crime.? President Biden has asked domestic policy adviser Susan Rice and White House public engagement director and senior adviser Cedric Richmond to conduct community listening sessions in the wake of the Atlanta-area shooting that left eight people dead, including six Asian women. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the President made the request ＾so that we can hear from the community and determine how that should impact policies moving forward.￣? Psaki pointed to the memorandum Biden signed in January to combat racism against Asian Americans in the United States.? ＾He did sign an executive order, and actually there are ongoing processes, including from the Department of Justice, where they're doing listening sessions now, HHS will start those soon,￣ Psaki said at a briefing Wednesday.?? ＾There's also an ongoing review of domestic violent extremism that is wide-ranging, that is a 100 day review that will take a look at a range of issues and that will also be a longer-term, strategic, comprehensive look at how that impacts our society and this will certainly be a part of that,￣ Psaki added. ? Investigators believe the gunman accused of shooting and killing several people at three different spas in the Atlanta area Tuesday purchased the weapon he used in the attack this week, law enforcement sources tell CNN.?? One of the sources said nothing in suspect Robert Aaron Long¨s background would have prevented the purchase. Long is accused of shooting and killing several people at three different spas in the Atlanta area Tuesday, according to authorities.? During a Wednesday news conference, Sheriff Frank Reynolds, Cherokee County Sheriff's Office said Long ＾made indicators that he has some issues, potentially, sexual addiction, and may have frequented some of these places in the past.￣? Reynolds told reporters that the family of Long turned him in to authorities on Tuesday. A law enforcement source said the suspect was recently kicked out of the house by his family due to his sexual addiction, which, the source said, included frequently spending hours on end watching pornography online. According to an incident report from CCSO, a 911 caller said the suspect could possibly be his son and ＾does have a tracker on his phone.￣ Another anonymous caller to 911 told dispatch the suspect was ＾kicked out of his parents' house last night,￣ adding that he ＾was emotional,￣ the incident report says.? Long, 21, has been charged with, ＾four counts of Murder and one count of Aggravated Assault and has no bond,￣ the CCSO said in a Wednesday statement. He is currently detained at the Cherokee County Adult Detention Center. He could face separate charges for the shootings he¨s suspected of committing in Atlanta, but authorities there have not charged him yet.? According to two law enforcement sources involved in the investigation, Long attempted to justify his actions when he told police he thought about killing himself, but decided instead to ""help"" others with sexual addictions by targeting spas. One of the sources tells CNN, the suspect is on suicide watch and was wearing a vest intended to protect him from self-harm in the mug shot.? FBI agents from the bureau's Atlanta field office civil rights team continue to investigate whether race was a factor in the murders, one of the sources said. After eight people ！ six of whom were Asian women ！ were killed in shootings at Atlanta-area spas, Georgia State Rep. Sam Park said it serves as a reminder to ＾protect the most vulnerable among us.￣ ＾There's been a lot of?concern with the Asian American?community, particularly given?the surge in violence and?discrimination we¨ve seen over?this past year, a lot of it being driven by?racist political rhetoric.?´ Regardless of?the motivation, given the?concerns the community already?has, in light of all the attacks?we have seen ！ particularly?against Asian American women and?the elderly ！?I think it¨s a reminder in which?we need to do everything we?possibly can to protect the most?vulnerable among us,￣ Park told CNN's Brianna Keilar.  Police have not yet offered a motive in the shootings saying it's too early in the investigation to determine if they were a hate crime.? Park recommended that people contact their local leaders if they feel unsafe or threatened.? ＾Make your voice heard. Reach out to your community members, reach out to elected officials,?law enforcement.?And raise those concerns so that?we can do as much as we can to?provide support,￣ he said.? First lady Jill Biden addressed shootings in Georgia this afternoon during remarks at?Christa McAuliffe Elementary School in Concord, New Hampshire. ＾I want to start by saying something directly to the families of the shooting victims in Atlanta last night,￣ Biden said Wednesday.?＾My heart is with you. And I hope that all Americans will join me in praying for everyone touched by this senseless tragedy.￣ Eight people were killed Tuesday during a shooting spree across three metro Atlanta spas on Tuesday, including six Asian women, officials say. Local police have yet to definitively offer a motive in the Tuesday spree, but because of many of the victims' backgrounds, some public officials and organizations have raised concerns that ethnicity came into play.  It comes following an alarming spike in violence directed at the Asian American community in recent months. Attorney Christopher Chan, advisory chair of the Asian American Action Fund Georgia Chapter, said the Atlanta shootings is of high concern ＾because it's such a high-profile?event that has occurred against?our community.￣ Chan told CNN¨s Brianna Keilar that Asian communities in Georgia are ＾in shock￣ and ＾outraged"" following the fatal shooting rampage that left six Asian women dead. ＾We want attention drawn to this?rising epidemic of hate crime,?of crimes being committed?against Asian Americans.?We want a stronger police?presence if not attention to?those crimes that are being?perpetrated against our?community. And we actually welcome our?Black and Latinx community?leaders to stand with us in this?call for increased attention to?these crimes being committed?against the Asian American?community,￣ Chan said. Chan told Keilar that steps like Congress passing the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act could help ＾strengthen the reportings?around alleged hate crimes?against Asian Americans.￣ He added, ＾It?would also set into place some Department of?Justice procedures as well as?coordination among state and?local law enforcement as to the?language being used to describe?Covid-19, particularly getting?rid of and correcting?descriptions as to how Covid-19?is being described in the news?and media."" Police have yet to report a motive in the attack.  Watch: President Joe Biden said that brutality against Asian Americans is ""very, very troubling,"" but he would make ""no connection"" when it comes to the possible motivation of the man accused of killing eight people in Georgia until the investigation is complete. The President said he was briefed by the attorney general and the director of the FBI on the phone on Tuesday. ""The investigation?is ongoing and the question of?motivation is still to be?determined.?But whatever the motivation?here, I know Asian Americans are ... they are very?concerned, because as you know I?have been speaking about the?brutality against?Asian Americans for the last couple of months and I think it is very, very troubling,"" Biden said before hosting a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister of Ireland. ""I am making no connection at this moment of the motivation of the killer. I am waiting for an answer from C as the investigation proceeds C from the FBI and from the Justice Department,"" he added. ""I'll have more to say when the?investigation is completed."" While police have not yet offered a motive in the attacks, the shootings follow a spike in violence directed at the Asian American community in recent months. Watch: CNN went to the home of the grandparents of?Georgia shooting suspect Robert Aaron Long in Morristown, Tennessee, on Wednesday.? ＾All I want to say is that he is our grandson and we still love him very much,￣ said Long¨s grandmother, Margaret Long, who was visibly upset.  Long¨s grandfather interrupted the conversation, saying they¨d been told not to speak to anyone and gave no further comment.? Some context: Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds told reporters earlier today that the family of suspected spa shooter Robert Aaron Long turned him into authorities Tuesday.? Reynolds said he talked to the family and they ""were very distraught and they were very helpful in this apprehension,￣ he said.? An Asian American justice group has blamed White supremacy and racism as the cause for Tuesday night's Atlanta shooting and is calling for communities of color to band together to condemn racist violence. In a statement released Wednesday, Stephanie Cho, executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, said: ＾We are heartbroken by these acts of violence. Six Asian women lost their lives. Now is the time to hold the victims and their families in our hearts and in our light. We¨re calling on our allies across communities of color to stand with us in grief and solidarity against racist violence in all its forms. When our most vulnerable community members are targeted, we all need to band together."" ""While the details of the shootings are still emerging, this happened under the trauma of increasing violence against Asian Americans nationwide, fueled by white supremacy and systemic racism. While anti-Asian violence is woven throughout our nation¨s history, the Trump administration¨s scapegoating of Asians for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has increased the incidence of hate and violence against Asian Americans.?According to the most recent data, hate incidents targeting Asian Americans rose by nearly 150% in 2020, with Asian American women twice as likely to be targeted,"" the statement continued. Phi Nguyen, litigation director at the organization, said: ＾That the Asian women murdered yesterday were working highly vulnerable jobs during an ongoing pandemic speaks directly to the compounding impacts of sexism, structural violence, and white supremacy.￣ The statement called for local and state government to ""provide robust in-language interpretation and translation for crisis intervention resources, including support for mental health and immigration services.

"Covid-19 reinfections are rare, unless you are over 65",18/3/2021,"A version of this story appeared in the March 18 edition of CNN's Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction newsletter. Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.
The study, which looked at reinfection rates among 4 million people in Denmark, found that most people who have had Covid-19 seemed to have protection from reinfection for more than six months. In a follow-up after six months, the study found no evidence that protection was waning. But a check of the demographics of who was getting infected again showed it was mostly people 65 and older, Jen Christensen reports. 
The older age group had only about 47% protection against repeat infection, compared to younger people who seemed to have about 80% protection from reinfection, the team wrote. The finding is not completely unexpected, since as people age their immune systems weaken. 
""Given what is at stake, the results emphasize how important it is that people adhere to measures implemented to keep themselves and others safe, even if they have already had COVID-19,"" study co-author Dr. Steen Ethelberg of the Statens Serum Institut in Denmark said in a statement. 
That advice is not being heeded in some parts of the US where governors are lifting measures aimed at preventing its spread. Even though nearly 1 in 8 Americans are fully vaccinated, the country may be on the cusp of a second surge, after case numbers that were declining in recent weeks appeared to level off.  
Chicago officials earlier this month raised indoor capacity for bars, restaurants and other businesses, while Baltimore leaders said yesterday that they were easing restrictions on places including religious facilities, retail stores, malls, and fitness centers. 
""We're in a race to get the population vaccinated,"" Dr. Richard Besser, the former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told CNN on Wednesday. ""At the same time, we're fighting people's exhaustion with the restrictions that public health has put in place and we're fighting the move by so many governors to remove the restrictions that are keeping us all safe.""

Q: I have a high BMI and qualify for the vaccine. Does this mean I am unhealthy?
A: With obesity a factor in Covid-19 vaccine eligibility, many Americans are scrambling to find out their body mass index, or BMI. But experts say the meaning behind those numbers -- and how to lower them -- isn't always so clear-cut. 
The CDC lists obesity as an underlying medical condition, and defines it as someone who has a body mass index of between 30 and 40.  
Having a BMI of over 30 can lead to severe health problems such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and obesity increases the risk of having a more severe reaction to Covid-19. 
Having a high BMI, however, doesn't necessarily mean you're unhealthy. There are some rare cases when a healthy person can have an apparently unhealthy BMI. This includes weight trainers and people with athletic builds who have a lot of muscle on them, creating a high BMI number, said Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. 
If you're unsure if your high BMI number is due to fat or muscle, Apovian recommends seeing a weight loss specialist to have more specific tests done.

Covid-19 drove hundreds of Africans out of Guangzhou. A generation of mixed-race children is their legacy 
At the turn of the 21st century, the Chinese city of Guangzhou -- already a magnet for internal migrants -- became an accidental experiment in multiculturalism in China, as loose immigration rules and factories churning out cheap products attracted droves of African entrepreneurs. Business boomed, and by 2012 as many as 100,000 sub-Saharan Africans had flocked to the city, making it the largest African expatriate community in Asia, Jenni Marsh reports.  
But the pandemic drove hundreds of Africans out of the city, sparked the most severe anti-Black racial clashes in China in decades, and remade business operations, with Chinese factories connecting with African customers directly over e-commerce platforms. The ones who remain are rooted there due to their Chinese partners and children.  
 
EU continues attack on AstraZeneca as it unveils vaccine passports 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen attacked AstraZeneca for alleged under-production and under-delivery, blaming them in part for the slow vaccine rollout in Europe. 
This comes as the EU's medicines regulator prepares to issue guidance on the safety of the vaccine after many countries suspended their rollouts following reports of blood clots. The regulator has already said there is no evidence of a link between the AstraZeneca shots and clots.  
Von der Leyen stressed that she trusted the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, but warned that an export ban the EU brought in during its recent row with the drug company could be used if it felt other countries were not exporting sufficient numbers of vaccines. 
The EU also unveiled its proposal for a ""Digital Green Certificate,"" or vaccine passport, to allow for safe and free movement within the bloc during the pandemic. The certificate confirming that a person has been vaccinated against Covid-19, has received a negative test result or has recovered from Covid-19 can be used across all 27 member states.  

Tanzania's President, who undermined his country's Covid-19 response, has died  
After dismissing the seriousness of Covid-19, Tanzania's President John Magufuli died at a hospital in Dar es Salaam from a heart ailment. At the start of the pandemic, Magufuli urged citizens to ""pray coronavirus away,"" said the ""satanic virus can't live in the body of Jesus Christ,"" and blamed the growing number of positive cases on faulty test kits. 
In June, he claimed his country had eradicated coronavirus ""by the grace of God,"" questioned the safety of foreign Covid-19 vaccines and made no plan to procure any shots for his country, instead pushing for the use of herbal medicine and steam treatments. Tanzania hasn't reported Covid-19 figures since April 2020, prompting the World Health Organization to call for the East African country to publish data and ramp up public health measures.

"Violence towards Asian Americans is 'hitting differently' amid the pandemic, says former NBA star Jeremy Lin",18/3/2021,"Lin was speaking to CNN's Anderson Cooper following the killing of eight people at three Atlanta-area spas earlier this week, six of whom were Asian. 
Lin, who spent nine years in the NBA and currently plays for the Santa Cruz Warriors in the G League, has recently spoken out about how the pandemic has exacerbated anti-Asian violence, notably after saying he was called ""coronavirus"" during a basketball game.
""Growing up it was always something that might be a little more subtle or verbal, but I think what we're seeing right now is a lot of physical, actual violence, lives being taken,"" Lin said.
""A lot of Asian Americans who are looking over their shoulders when they go outside, when they go to the grocery store, and we're starting to slowly see more and more reporting of what is going on.
""But this is something that is definitely hitting different.""

Police say that 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long is suspected of opening fire at the spas late Tuesday afternoon and early evening, first at a business about 30 miles northwest of Atlanta, followed by two more at spas in northeastern Atlanta.
According to Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds, preliminary information indicates that the killings may not have been racially motivated, but instead could relate to the suspect's claim of a potential sex addiction. 
But because of the victims' backgrounds, public officials have raised fears that ethnicity had come into play given the backdrop of rising anti-Asian violence amid the pandemic.
""It feels like it's happening more, and it feels like it's getting worse and even for me, I'm starting to question: 'Oh, if I speak out more, am I encouraging more people to have even more hate, by other people seeing these headlines?'"" Lin said when asked about the Atlanta shootings.
Advocates and authorities have received reports of thousands of xenophobic attacks against Asian people since the pandemic began.
Lin, who became the first Asian American to win an NBA title in 2019 while with the Toronto Raptors, says he was targeted multiple times with racist slurs during his college basketball career and that Covid-19 has intensified a pre-existing problem.
""We're seeing all these micro-aggressions through history,"" Lin said.
""Asians have always been projected as being others or outsiders and you can hear and see these micro-aggressions, like: 'Where are you really from?' or talking about the way that we look or our complexion or things like that.""
Lin also pointed to how he thinks certain rhetoric around the virus has contributed to anti-Asian discrimination. Former US President Donald Trump, for example, received criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" during his presidency.
""There are so many micro-aggressions that contribute to that and again, calling it the China virus, Kung Flu virus, that is adding to it and fueling the fire,"" he said.
""Now we're starting to see a lot of those micro-aggressions turn into actual acts of violence. It is really hard to watch. I encourage people to watch these videos to see this is actually happening. These are real stories, real lives.""

""Now we're starting to see a lot of those micro-aggressions turn into actual acts of violence. It is really hard to watch. I encourage people to watch these videos to see this is actually happening. These are real stories, real lives.""",sport,SPORT
White supremacy and hate are haunting Asian Americans,18/3/2021,"The murders of eight people, including six Asian women, among them four South Koreans, further disoriented and horrified a community already unfairly stigmatized by racial association during a pandemic that originated in China. And they laid bare for the rest of the country the agony of yet another minority group left to question its place in America, at a time of rising attacks and harassment amid cresting White nationalism and domestic extremism.
Many Asian Americans feel exposed by a torrent of dangerous and racially motivated rhetoric by national figures on a cultural crusade. Most prominently that includes ex-President Donald Trump, who presided over four years of rising racial tensions and often used division as a tool of personal power.
Campaigners talk of a perfect storm of prejudice targeting the Asian American and Pacific Islander community that stirred latent hatreds as Covid-19 first arrived in the US, and was exacerbated by Trump's relish in flinging around terms like ""China virus.""

The White supremacist threat
 
Vivien Tsou, national field director for the National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum, described a personal sense of dislocation and horror after Tuesday's killings, that she said were deeply felt in her community.
On a day when the new Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told lawmakers that domestic extremism was the greatest threat to the homeland, Tsou argued that Asian Americans did not face distinct peril but were targeted by the same forces of hate endured by Black Americans and that were evident in the insurrection against the US Capitol on January 6.
""While the focus is on anti-Asian hate, it all stems from White supremacy and anyone can be a scapegoat at any moment,"" Tsou said. 
""This is something that we need to face together and stand in solidarity,"" she said, referring to other ethnic minority groups.
More broadly, the ordeal of the Asian American community revealed another dimension of the much discussed national reckoning over race. A flurry of current events -- from the crisis on the southwestern border, to Republicans' voter suppression efforts, to the disparities in Covid-19 vaccine availability -- all revolve to some extent around questions of ethnicity. And they are highlighting the particular pain of minority Americans that can never be felt and is rarely truly appreciated by those in the White majority.
On Wednesday, a prospective juror in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the police officer charged in the killing of George Floyd, was asked by a defense lawyer whether he had personal views that could shape his judgment.
""Being a Black man in America, I experience racism every day,"" the unidentified man said. He was later excused from service despite insisting he could deliver a fair verdict. 
The exchange didn't just crystallize the question at the heart of a case with grave national implications -- whether the US legal system can deliver justice to a dead Black man or whether an accused White police officer can get a fair trial in such emotive circumstances. It exposed the racism many Blacks, Asians and other minorities believe endemic that other Americans only see after tragedies or national outrages.
Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a Democrat, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the Asian American community needed the same consideration shown to Black Americans in the  aftermath of Floyd's death amid a national outpouring over police violence.
""In the same way African Americans across this country ask for support and we asked for people to stand with us over the summer, it's important that people stand with our Asian brothers and sisters in the same way,"" she said. ""They are being targeted unfairly and in Atlanta, what we've seen -- the worst has happened.""
How much is Trump to blame?
 
The extent to which Trump, who often refused to unequivocally condemn White supremacy, and his enablers are to blame for the rising racial prejudice is at the center of controversy in the wake of Tuesday's attack.
Democratic Rep. Judy Chu of California told CNN on Wednesday that the hysteria whipped up by the ex-President -- who at times referred to Covid-19 as ""kung flu"" has been disastrous for the community.
""Since the start of the pandemic, he's been calling this the China virus,"" Chu told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. ""So, now we have had a spike in anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents.""
The extent to which the plight of Asian Americans was caught up in Trump's scorched earth strategy was revealed during a debate about a Democratic House resolution condemning violence against the community in September.
A total of 164 Republicans voted against the measure, which some described as ""woke culture on steroids."" Some members objected to drawing a parallel between the impact of the phrase ""China virus"" and the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II and historic discrimination against Chinese immigrants -- both of which scarred America's conscience and still resonates with many Asian Americans.
The World Health Organization has advised against linking the virus directly to any region or ethnic group precisely because of the hate and harassment that has been endured by Asian Americans.
But one of Trump's top allies, Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, said in the debate that the measure was an example of ""cancel culture"" designed to prevent Americans talking truthfully about where the virus was first discovered.
And even though Trump is no longer in office, much of the Republican Party can't shake its relish for raising the specter of outsiders -- often people of color -- while hinting that they threaten majority White American culture.
In a trip to the southern border this week, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, said that in addition to a stream of Central Americans, Yemenis, Iranians, Sri Lankans and ""even"" Chinese were crossing the frontier.
Victims demand recognition
 
Increasing attacks on Asian Americans over the last year, including on elder members of the community, have left many scared to leave their homes or unwilling to venture beyond their immediate family networks. People have been verbally abused and accused of spreading Covid-19. Lin was called ""coronavirus"" on court. There have been especially troubling cases of xenophobic violence against elderly Asian Americans.
""The Asian American community here is in shock,"" Christopher Chan, the advisory chair of the Asian American Action Fund Georgia Chapter, told CNN on Wednesday. ""We want attention drawn to this rising epidemic of hate crime, of crimes being committed against Asian Americans.""
The specific motive behind the shooting spree in Georgia in which Robert Aaron Long, 21, has been charged, remains unclear according to police.
But Bottoms said on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" that it was hard to believe the alleged killer's reported statement that he was acting on a motive rooted in sex addiction.
""The fact that many of the victims were Asian ... and that he targeted these Asian massage parlors. It's very difficult to ignore that the Asian community has been targeted and it's happening across the country,"" the mayor said.
Whether the rationale for the killing was racial or not, it does seem to have been motivated by some form of hate.
""I know there has been a lot of questions about whether it is racially motivated,"" Tsou said. ""It is not just race, it is gender. These women were doing a day job to provide for their family. They were going out in a pandemic. This is another layer of fear that we have put upon our communities.""
Community advocates say there has long been an issue of Asian women being objectified because they work in massage parlors or spas.
Esther Kao, speaking on behalf of Red Canary Song, a New York collective that advocates for labor rights for (mostly Asian) massage parlor workers and sex workers, said women in the industry had faced a recent surge of racism.
""But it's not specific to the sex industry; Chinatown restaurants, workers have also gotten the same kind of threats, and also like lost income during this time,"" Kao told CNN's ""Meanwhile in America"" newsletter on Wednesday.
","In one sense, it's immaterial whether the accused killer in the Atlanta spa shootings admits to a racist motivation. Asian Americans, already traumatized by a rising tide of hate, violence and rhetoric, have been living in fear for months. The murders of eight people, including six Asian women, among them four South Koreans, further disoriented and horrified a community already unfairly stigmatized by racial association during a pandemic that originated in China.

Fact-checking GOP claims that people on terror watch list are 'rushing' the border,18/3/2021,"Among the more notable claims made were comments from GOP House leader Kevin McCarthy, who said that people on the terror watch list were now attempting to enter the US through the southern border.
""They're now finding people from Yemen, Iran, Turkey. People on the terror watch list they're catching. And they're rushing it all at once,"" McCarthy told Fox News. He suggested during a news conference that recently detained individuals on the terror watch list were also coming from Sri Lanka and China. 

Rep. John Katko, who was also part of the Republican cohort visiting the border, echoed McCarthy's claim on Fox News Tuesday morning, saying that the US Border Patrol told him they had encountered migrants on the terror watch list. 
""I was stunned,"" Katko said. ""And I've never heard that before."" 
Facts First: There's no evidence of a sudden rush of individuals on the terror watch list showing up at the southern border. The information that is available is vague and leaves many questions unanswered. That said, it's entirely false to imply a small number of individuals on the terror watch list coming to the southern border is a new phenomenon. Furthermore, it's worth noting that being on the FBI's terror watch list does not mean someone is a terrorist or has proven ties to terrorists.
Here's what we do know: 
On Tuesday, CNN's requests to McCarthy's office for evidence supporting his claims went unacknowledged for hours. Then around 2:30 pm, Axios reported that according to an unnamed congressional aide, CBP had confirmed to Congress on Tuesday that ""four people arrested at the southern border since Oct. 1 match names on the FBI's Terrorist Screening Database.""   
After the Axios report published, a representative from McCarthy's office pointed to it in response to CNN's request for comment. According to the report, one of the individuals was from Serbia and the other three were from Yemen. 
On Tuesday evening, in response to the Axios reporting, Arizona Democrat Rep. Ruben Gallego challenged the substance of those claims in an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett, saying, ""There is no correlation from what I'm reading to what Mr. McCarthy and other people are talking about."" 
""I actually just had a briefing about 90 minutes ago regarding this issue and none of what I heard in that briefing matches this information,"" Gallego told CNN.
When Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas was asked about the reporting during a congressional hearing Wednesday, Mayorkas said individuals on the terror watchlist being encountered at the southern border ""is not a new phenomenon"" and has taken place for years.
The Axios reporting does not clarify when these four individuals were apprehended but says the arrests occurred at some point during the five and a half months between October and March 16. Fox News reported Tuesday that one of the individuals ""was encountered on Jan. 28."" It's also unclear whether the individuals were actually on the list or if their names merely matched those among the hundreds of thousands kept in the database. And it's currently unknown if the four people are still in custody or have been released.  
After repeated requests to clarify McCarthy's claim, Customs and Border Protection provided CNN a statement Tuesday evening, which noted that ""encounters of known and suspected terrorists at our borders are very uncommon.""
The watchlist
In an FAQ, the FBI says that anyone they suspect to be ""involved in terrorist activities"" could be on the terror watch list. A DHS official told CNN ""one should not immediately conclude"" why someone is on the watch list.
Most individuals flagged by the watch list attempt to enter the US on planes. Encountering a very small number on the border who are on the terrorist watch list is not unique to the Biden administration. 
Individuals on the terror watch list were encountered at the US southern border by federal agents during President Donald Trump's time in office. Furthermore, the number of these individuals encountered at the border in a given year is extremely small and is a very small percentage of the total known or suspected terrorists who try to enter or travel to the US annually. 
In January 2019, CNN reported that roughly a dozen non-US citizens who were on the terror watch list had been encountered on the US southern border by federal officers from October 2017 to October 2018, according to an administration official familiar with CBP data.
Alex Nowrasteh, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, told CNN that most years the number of those undocumented immigrants on the terror watch list encountered at the southern border ""is in the low single digits.""
""The numbers are so small it's hard to say anything statistically significant about them,"" Nowrasteh said, noting additionally that not a single American has ""been killed by an illegal immigrant in a terrorist attack on US soil -- that hasn't happened."" 

Previous allegations
Republican allegations of terrorists crossing the US southern border are not new. 
Amid a wave of migration in January 2019, Trump claimed ""we have terrorists coming through the southern border because they find that's probably the easiest place to come through. They drive right in and they make a left.""
But the then-President's claims of terrorists coming through Mexico were contradicted by his own State Department. 
A report from the State Department's Bureau of Counterterrorism found that ""(i)n 2019, there was no credible evidence indicating international terrorist groups established bases in Mexico, worked directly with Mexican drug cartels, or sent operatives via Mexico into the United States.""
","Amid a significant increase in the number of migrants showing up at the US southern border, a group of Republican lawmakers spoke on Monday in El Paso, Texas, to criticize the Biden administration's immigration policy. Among the more notable claims made were comments from GOP House leader Kevin McCarthy, who said that people on the terror watch list were now attempting to enter the US through the southern border.

South Korea president welcomes 'return of diplomacy' in first meeting with top US diplomat,18/3/2021,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had been in Seoul meeting their counterparts since Wednesday, after stopping in Tokyo, in the first international trip by Biden Cabinet officials since the inauguration.
Speaking at the Presidential Blue House, Moon congratulated Blinken and Austin on their roles in the new administration, and said he looked ""forward to US leadership in the midst of complex crises.""
""Having been a partner for seven decades, sharing values and philosophy on democracy and human rights, ROK (the Republic of Korea) and the US will continue to act together on shared challenges, including a thorough cooperation for a complete denuclearization and permanent peace in the Korean Peninsula,"" he said.

Blinken echoed this sentiment, saying the US officials had good working meetings with their South Korean counterparts and had ""a very strong work plan for the coming months.""
Earlier in the day, Blinken and Austin met with South Korea's Minister of Foreign Affairs Chung Eui-yong and Minister of National Defense Suh Wook in a joint ""2+2"" session.
In a joint statement, they said the alliance between their countries ""has never been more important"" in the midst of increasing global threats. 
They also affirmed that North Korean nuclear and missile issues are a priority for the US and South Korean alliance, and the two countries ""reiterated the importance of maintaining joint readiness against all shared threats to the Alliance through combined training and exercises."" 
North Korea had issued a statement on Wednesday and Thursday denouncing joint exercises between the US and South Korea.
""We have a strong stance on improving human rights in North Korea and are trying continuously to make it better,"" said Chung in an interview with Korea's Yonhap News Agency. ""We have explained to the US government that we need to make these efforts along with practical improvements inside North Korea.""
At the meeting, Blinken called on China to play its role in North Korea's denuclearization, saying Beijing and Pyongyang had a ""unique relationship.""
""I think it has a shared interest in making sure we do something about North Korea's nuclear program and the increasingly dangerous ballistic missile program,"" Blinken said, adding that he hopes ""China will use that influence effectively to move North Korea to denuclearization.""

Pinduoduo's founder leaves as his Chinese e-commerce giant grows bigger than ever,18/3/2021,"Colin Huang's decision to resign as chairman wasn't a complete surprise. The 41-year-old entrepreneur already quit as CEO last summer, and was expected to eventually leave leadership at Pinduoduo altogether.
But his exit still came faster than expected, and during an uncertain time for many of China's internet firms as Beijing works to rein in the sector. 
""The abrupt resignation of Mr. Huang was a big negative surprise to investors,"" wrote Nomura analysts Jialong Shi and Thomas Shen in a Thursday research note. ""Mr. Huang was widely regarded as the signature person of the company whose strong insight and leadership have been deemed by many investors as a key factor to the success"" of Pinduoduo. 
Shares in Pinduoduo (PDD) plummeted 7% in New York on Wednesday following Huang's announcement.
Huang founded Pinduoduo in 2015 and quickly turned it into a formidable e-commerce company. It's still a long way from surpassing industry leader Alibaba in market share ！ it holds about 10% of the market, behind Alibaba's 53% and competitor JD.com's (JD) 19%, according to estimates by Guiyang-based Huachuang Securities. But the company is edging out its biggest competitor in at least one important way: It announced Wednesday that it had nearly 789 million active users in 2020, surpassing Alibaba's 779 million.
And while it posted a $1.1 billion loss last year, the company is also still growing. It said Wednesday that revenue for 2020 doubled over the prior year to $9.2 billion. Its rise can be attributed to its success with people in small cities and rural areas, markets that other e-commerce firms have largely missed out on over the years. Its grocery division also grew significantly during the pandemic, playing a role in last year's expansion.
Huang ！ who has a net worth of about $53 billion, according to Bloomberg, and is China's third richest person behind Nongfu Spring founder Zhong Shanshan and Tencent (TCEHY) founder Pony Ma ！ told shareholders that he resigned because he wanted more time to pursue other goals, including his childhood dream of becoming a scientist or researcher. 
""Although Pinduoduo is still a young company with a long runway for growth, it is about the right time to explore what's next if we want the same quality and pace of growth in 10 years,"" he wrote to them in a letter Wednesday. He also cited a desire to allow ""a new generation of leaders and managers"" to ""shape the Pinduoduo they aspire to build."" He remains the company's largest shareholder.
It's not unusual in China for entrepreneurs to leave companies, even when they're in their prime. In 2018, Alibaba (BABA) co-founder Jack Ma announced that he would resign as executive chairman and pursue more work in philanthropy. He was 54 at the time. (Ma has not escaped scrutiny since his resignation and was questioned by regulators late last year over Ant Group, the Alibaba financial affiliate he helped to build. Its high profile IPO was shelved afterward.)
But Huang also leaves Pinduoduo in a somewhat precarious position. Beijing has been cracking down on the tech sector for months, and its reach has on occasion extended to Pinduoduo. 
Earlier this month, regulators fined Pinduoduo 1.5 million yuan ($230,000) over accusations that it sold food on its platform at unreasonably low prices to edge out rivals.
Pinduoduo also recently faced backlash over allegations that it overworks its employees, including from Chinese social media users who called out the deaths of two workers as emblematic of a troublesome work culture. The company at the time said it set up a team to provide psychological counseling following the suicide of one worker.
On Monday, just two days before Huang said he would step down, Chinese President Xi Jinping called on the country's regulators to increase their scrutiny of the country's internet and tech firms ！ particularly those that have accumulated a lot of user data.

","Pinduoduo's founder stepped down suddenly this week, shaking investors who had watched him take the Chinese e-commerce company from nothing to a potential Alibaba competitor in less than a decade.  Colin Huang's decision to resign as chairman wasn't a complete surprise. The 41-year-old entrepreneur already quit as CEO last summer, and was expected to eventually leave leadership at Pinduoduo altogether. But his exit still came faster than expected, and during an uncertain time for many of China's internet firms as Beijing works to rein in the sector.  ""The abrupt resignation of Mr. Huang was a big negative surprise to investors,"" wrote Nomura analysts Jialong Shi and Thomas Shen in a Thursday research note. ""Mr. Huang was widely regarded as the signature person of the company whose strong insight and leadership have been deemed by many investors as a key factor to the success"" of Pinduoduo.

Hong Kong leader's art museum comments prompt new censorship fears,19/3/2021,,"Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has told officials to be ""extra cautious"" in ensuring exhibitions at a major new art museum do not breach the city's sweeping national security law, prompting fresh fears over censorship in the territory. Asked by pro-Beijing lawmaker Eunice Yung whether the long-awaited M+ museum risked ""inciting hatred"" towards China with some of its artworks, Lam told Hong Kong's Legislative Council that she recognized concerns that the institution's exhibits may cross an unspecified ""red line.""  She added that her government respects the ""freedom of artistic and cultural expression,"" but said that since the enactment of the national security legislation -- which criminalizes acts of secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign forces -- ""all Hong Kong compatriots are required to safeguard national security."" Lam's comments come just days after M+ director Suhanya Raffel said she would be free to show politically sensitive works, including those by Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei. The museum's 8,000-item collection also contains various references to the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, a topic considered off-limits by galleries in mainland China, as well as satirical depictions of former Chinese leader Mao Zedong.  Set to open to the public at the end of 2021, M+ will see 17,000 square meters (around 183,000 square feet) of exhibition space set across 33 galleries. Often touted as Asia's answer to the Museum of Modern Art in New York or the Tate Modern in London, the ambitious museum is the flagship venue of the West Kowloon Cultural District, a sprawling arts quarter built on 100 acres of land reclaimed from Victoria Harbour. But the introduction of the national security law, a response to the pro-democracy protests that rocked the city in 2019, has raised concerns about the possibility of censorship -- or self-censorship -- at the museum.  While the legislation does not explicitly address political art, the city's artists and curators have nonetheless expressed fears that pro-democracy, or anti-China, works may fall foul of its vague parameters.  For M+, this has raised questions over some of the 1,500 items donated by Swiss collector Uli Sigg. Considered one of the most comprehensive collections of contemporary Chinese art, Sigg's items include a number of works by Ai, such as a 1997 photograph showing the artist holding up a middle finger to Tiananmen Square.  The collection also includes several images from the 1989 crackdown by Hong Kong-born photographer Liu Heung Shing, including wounded demonstrators being rushed to a hospital and a couple hiding beneath a bridge as tanks roll above them.  Process of 'cultural politicization' The museum is yet to reveal which of the collection's artworks will be on public display upon its opening later this year. But at a press conference marking the building's completion last week, director Raffel said that there would be ""no problem"" displaying Ai's work or pieces alluding to the Tiananmen Square massacre.  In a statement provided to CNN on Thursday, the publicly funded museum elaborated on its position, saying that it would ""comply with the laws of Hong Kong,"" while ""maintaining the highest level of professional integrity."" ""(The museum's) exhibition and collection development is based on research and academic rigor,"" the statement read. ""Like any museum, it is the role of M+ to ensure that our collections and exhibitions are presented in a relevant and appropriate manner to stimulate discussion, research, learning, knowledge and pleasure."" Thus far, Hong Kong's national security law has primarily been used against opposition activists and pro-democracy figures, such as media tycoon Jimmy Lai. But it has also coincided with the virtual disappearance of protest art, as well as the growing use of carefully-worded disclaimers by cultural venues attempting to distance themselves from potential wrongdoing. For artist Kacey Wong, once a regular fixture at Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests, the legislation's ambiguous wording leaves it open to abuse by authorities.   ""(Carrie Lam's) so-called 'red line' is so flexible that it's open for the government or its agents to use it to prosecute anybody they don't like,"" Wong said in a phone interview. ""Hong Kong is going through this cultural politicization process right now,"" he added. ""It's kind of like what Ai Weiwei (said), that 'everything is art, everything is politics.'""  Just this week, the screening of a documentary about the Hong Kong protests, ""Inside the Red Brick Wall,"" was reportedly pulled by a local movie theater. The decision followed a front-page editorial in one of the city's pro-Beijing newspapers, Ta Kung Pao, decrying the use of public arts funding for cultural organizations it deemed in violation of the national security law.  According to Wong, these latest controversies collectively point to a wider squeeze on artistic expression. ""All these events are linked together,"" he said, adding: ""So it's not just (about) Uli Sigg's collection -- it's almost a purge within the government systems of arts and culture.""

Covid-19 drove hundreds of Africans out of Guangzhou. A generation of mixed-race children is their legacy,18/3/2021,"In reality, it was a year before Dieng -- who had worked as a goods trader in the manufacturing hub of Guangzhou in southern China for two decades -- could return, on an air ticket three times the usual cost, and a complicated business visa. By then, the pandemic had driven hundreds of Africans out of Guangzhou, sparked the most severe anti-Black racial clashes in China in decades, and remade business operations, with Chinese factories connecting with African customers directly over e-commerce platforms.  
""Now it is very, very quiet,"" Dieng says of Little Africa, a nook of Guangzhou informally named after the swell of thriving African businessmen who once lived, ate and prayed there in huge numbers. ""Not many foreigners now, and all the small shops are closed. Small business around here? No more.""

At the turn of the 21st century, Guangzhou -- already a magnet for internal migrants -- became an accidental experiment in multiculturalism in China, as loose immigration rules and factories churning out cheap products attracted droves of African entrepreneurs.
Business boomed, and by 2012 as many as 100,000 Sub-Saharan Africans had flocked to the city, according to Prof. Adams Bodomo's book ""Africans in China."" While that figure was never verified, it pointed to the generally accepted opinion that, between 2005 and 2012, at least, this was the largest African expatriate community in Asia. 
As interracial marriages in the community flourished, Bodomo theorized that, in time, an African-Chinese minority would arise, becoming China's 57th ethnic group and demanding full citizenship rights. Today, that looks unlikely. By April last year, just 4,550 Africans were living in Guangzhou, according to local authorities, including students and diplomats as well as businesspeople.   
Ten months on, more than a dozen experts and Africans who spoke with CNN said that number has further dwindled, due to several repatriation flights to Nigeria and Kenya, and tougher coronavirus-era visa rules, with most foreigners barred from entry to China.  Many who remain are rooted in China by Chinese wives and children.
""For the whole issue of African traders in Guangzhou, I suspect that era is over,"" says Gordon Mathews, professor and chair of the Department of Anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""I'm skeptical that (their physical presence in the city) will ever be at the scale that it has been.""  
The business case
One reason for the decline of the African community over the past year is strictly business.
In 2019 alone, of the 2.95 million foreigners entering China through Guangzhou, 358,000 were from African countries, according to local officials. Many came on quick visits to buy from the region's factories, using African residents as middlemen to connect with Chinese wholesalers.  
When Covid-19 prevented foreigners from visiting China, the factory owners of the Pearl River Delta -- often cited as the world's biggest urban area -- had to rethink their business model. 
Many in the area, which includes the cities of Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Foshan and Dongguan, began advertising their services on e-commerce giants such as Alibaba. This allowed them to connect with African customers directly, rather than waiting for them to come to the city in person to place orders, as had been the way for decades.  
Pat Chukwuonye Chike has been in Guangzhou for nearly two decades, living on a business visa he renews each year. When Covid-19 hit, he stayed to avoid being separated from his Chinese wife and three African-Chinese children. He shuttered his clothing store, previously frequented by droves of visiting foreigners, and set up an Alibaba-type service on Facebook, which is banned in China but can be accessed via a virtual private netwoprk (VPN).

His online shop, Africa China Trade Service, connects about 20 factories he knows to his contacts in Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Guinea and Ghana. The advantage, he says, is his clients know they're dealing with factories they can trust.
But it's a competitive landscape. There are now hundreds of thousands of Chinese migrants in Africa who can easily order from Chinese factories themselves, and sell to locals where they are living -- cutting Africans out of the equation in their home nations. 
Some say that's what the Chinese authorities would prefer.
""China wants to be the middleman and not have Africans (in its borders),"" says Mathews, author of ""The World in Guangzhou."" ""So it would make much more sense for the Chinese merchants to move to Africa, rather than having the Africans go to China.""  
Racial tensions
For centuries, Guangzhou has intermittently been a nerve center for migrants, whether internal or foreign. When African traders arrived in the city in the early 2000s, they formed a particularly visible enclave -- partly because they tended to congregate in one or two relatively small areas, and partly because black skin had not before been widely seen in China in large numbers.
The Africans also brought with them value systems that did not easily fit in with China's political environment.
Many were deeply religious, founding underground Christian churches, which sometimes attracted Chinese congregations -- a deeply contentious practice in a country where proselytizing by foreigners is illegal. As Beijing clamped down on non-state sanctioned religion in recent years, their house churches were raided and shut down by local police.

Africans from Muslim nations also continued to practice Islam, a religion Guangzhou has a long connection with, being home to China's oldest mosque. Guangzhou attracted communities of Hui and Uyghurs, Muslim minorities in China, who began serving halal food to the African incomers, as did a range of Middle Eastern eateries. But in recent years, as hostility to Islamic populations increased across China in the wake of the crackdown on Islam in the country's western region of Xinjiang, Africans have reported that restaurants serving halal food began to remove Arabic writing from their menus and signage.
Africans also formed small democracies within their own communities, voting for a head of each nation within Guangzhou, to lobby on their behalf with the local authorities on matters such as visas. Permanent residency for foreigners is extremely rare in China, and most African parents live in a status of constantly renewing one-year visas.  

Those who cannot secure these often simply overstayed, creating an underground population of illegal African migrants in the city. A leaked WikiLeaks cable from 2008 revealed the central government was concerned by this, and had quietly funded research into the African community's impact on crime, underground religion and missed tax revenue. 
In 2011, the provincial authorities clamped down on overstayers, offering rewards to Chinese who turned them in, and making it illegal for employers, hoteliers or educational institutes to serve them. 
Then, in 2014, the government embarked on the ""beautification"" of Little Africa, the once-rural village consumed by the city. The campaign tore down signage in the area that celebrated foreign trade, swept up street stalls serving local cuisines, and introduced a heavy police presence. 
As policing of the community increased, several Africans running logistics warehouses told CNN that police installed CCTV cameras inside their premises, as well as X-ray scanners and devices plugged into their WiFi routers, in an apparent bid to clamp down on illegal exports.  
CNN reached out to officials in Guangdong, the province of which Guangzhou is the capital, for comments on these claims but did not receive a response.    
Racism in China
While many Africans spoke of leaving Guangzhou in the years leading up to the pandemic, much of the community remained, often rooted by marriages, children, a lack of better opportunity in Africa or elsewhere, and ultimately a sense of home. 
While there is no official data on how many Africans in Guangzhou married Chinese women, a walk through the strip malls of Little Africa in recent years made it clear: scores of shops are run by an African husband and his Chinese wife, with their children running down the corridors. 
Yet that sense of belonging was rocked for many last April when Africans across the city were evicted from their homes and hotels, and forced to live on the streets. After a handful of Nigerians tested positive for Covid-19, Guangzhou authorities quarantined and tested Africans all across the city, sparking unproven fears that Africans were vectors of the virus.
Last year, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said: ""The Chinese government treats all foreigners in China equally, opposes any differentiated practices targeted at specific groups of people, and has zero tolerance for discriminatory words and actions.""

Still, Vassor Dieng, a sofa seller in Senegal who imports from China, remembers that incident, which went viral on Twitter in Africa. She says she has no desire to go to Guangzhou once coronavirus restrictions lift. ""I'm hesitant now to go to China from what I have heard since Covid started, and how they treat people,"" she says.  
Back in Guangzhou, Nigerian father-of-three Chike says the way he is treated by some Chinese residents in his home city makes him feel they suspect Africans ""are the virus."" It's something, he says, he tries not to think about. ""Not everyone is comfortable in another country,"" he adds.
Many Africans in Guangzhou, however, report the city's Public Security Bureau has been lenient with visas for those with Chinese partners and children during the pandemic. Normally, a foreigner would have to leave and reenter China to activate a visa, something several Africans told CNN they had not been made to do, as it would trigger the need for a long quarantine.

Despite the challenges, many Africans want to return to their old lives in China. Congolese trader Felly Mwamba left the country during the Lunar New Year holiday in 2020 and has been living in Winnipeg since. After two decades in Guangzhou, he'd earned enough money to apply for Canadian citizenship and buy a home there, but the Winnipeg winter has been bitterly cold and he says he has few friends.
Yet he cannot get back into China. His business visa expired while he was in Canada, and to get a new one requires an invitation letter from local officials -- hard for him to obtain from another continent. In the meantime, he is paying rent on his office and apartment in China.
He's considering closing his languishing logistics business there, if he can't return soon. ""If really it is consistent going on like this, then I prefer to get out and relax,"" he said. ""See if I can do something in Africa.""
The legacy  
Whatever their future, the heyday of African trade, life and love in Guangzhou has produced a generation of African-Chinese children. While many are still adolescents, some have reached adulthood, and are navigating how their mixed identity will fit into China's increasingly nationalist landscape.

Zhong Fei Fei, 24, says her parents met at the turn of the century in Guangzhou, where her Congolese father was a graduate student and her Chinese mother was doing business. They fell in love, and moved to Brazzaville. But after her father died when she was a toddler, she grew up in China with her grandparents: they renamed her Zhong Fei Fei -- a name that roughly translates to China-Africa.
Since then, she says she has grappled with not being ""Chinese enough"" in China. She said a Shanghai school teacher once told her class she spoke Mandarin well for a ""foreigner."" ""I was so confused because how come I'm the foreigner?"" she remembers thinking. 
But she also has dealt with not being considered black enough in Congo. 
Last year, her identity came to the fore when producers of the Chinese version of K-pop reality TV show ""Produce Camp 2020"" invited her to star in the series.   
When Zhong emerged from the show, she was a trending topic on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform, but not for the right reasons -- many were attacking her for her race. ""I was looking at my phone and I had like 200,000 messages or something,"" she says of reconnecting to the world after exiting the show. The online attacks came at the same time authorities in Guangzhou were accused of mistreating Africans there.

Yet Zhong says she also received messages of support, and subsequently used the platform to launch a music career. 
For families in Guangzhou, Afro-Chinese celebrities like Zhong could be helpful for their children. Pastor Ignatius, a Nigerian evangelical preacher who has three African-Chinese children under the age of 12, hopes that ""what is happening in Japan might happen here,"" referencing the Afro-Japanese community there, from which many celebrated figures have emerged, such as tennis player Naomi Osaka.
""What we see from the school, they are very accepting -- though there are times of student discrimination here,"" he says, of the public Chinese school his children attend in Guangzhou. They all have Chinese passports -- without one, they would not be eligible for free education or healthcare. Dual nationality is  forbidden. 
Chike, who also has three African-Chinese children under age 13, says while there is ""more discrimination"" for the family to contend with in recent years, ""as long as my kids know who I am, where I'm from,"" they are free to live in the society they feel will be most beneficial. 
Mathews, the Hong Kong-based anthropologist, previously speculated during the height of African migration to Guangzhou that the African community could provide China with its own Barack Obama figure -- a non-Han leader. In an era of growing nationalism, he now believes this community of Afro-Chinese children will more likely dilute to the point where they won't have a collective voice. 
""They will probably blend in the overall landscape of Guangzhou because it has so many people from all over the place,"" says Mathews. ""I don't think they'll be noticeable ... it will be a few hundred people.""
","When the coronavirus pandemic ground China to a near-halt in early February last year, Youssouf Dieng jetted back to Dakar for, he thought, a brief sojourn.   In reality, it was a year before Dieng -- who had worked as a goods trader in the manufacturing hub of Guangzhou in southern China for two decades -- could return, on an air ticket three times the usual cost, and a complicated business visa.

It's something, he says, he tries not to think about. ""Not everyone is comfortable in another country,"" he adds. Many Africans in Guangzhou, however, report the city's Public Security Bureau has been lenient with visas for those with Chinese partners and children during the pandemic. Normally, a foreigner would have to leave and reenter China to activate a visa, something several Africans told CNN they had not been made to do, as it would trigger the need for a long quarantine. Despite the challenges, many Africans want to return to their old lives in China. Congolese trader Felly Mwamba left the country during the Lunar New Year holiday in 2020 and has been living in Winnipeg since. After two decades in Guangzhou, he'd earned enough money to apply for Canadian citizenship and buy a home there, but the Winnipeg winter has been bitterly cold and he says he has few friends. Yet he cannot get back into China. His business visa expired while he was in Canada, and to get a new one requires an invitation letter from local officials -- hard for him to obtain from another continent. In the meantime, he is paying rent on his office and apartment in China. He's considering closing his languishing logistics business there, if he can't return soon. ""If really it is consistent going on like this, then I prefer to get out and relax,"" he said. ""See if I can do something in Africa."" The legacy   ",china,

1. Spa shootings
We now know the names of four victims in the metro Atlanta spa shootings. Six of the eight who were killed were Asian women, who are uniquely vulnerable to violence because of their race and gender. Investigators said it was too early to say whether the crime was racially motivated and instead pointed to the suspect's claim of a potential sex addiction. Experts and activists say the disproportionate toll on Asian women was no coincidence and that the suspect's remarks are rooted in a history of misogyny and stereotypes directed at Asian women. The attacks are heightening the fear many Asian Americans were already feeling over a rising tide of hate and violence. The suspect faces charges of murder and aggravated assault, and Atlanta's mayor said a hate crime charge would be ""appropriate.""?

2. Coronavirus
Canada is expanding its use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to seniors, even as other countries pause their rollouts. Europe, meanwhile, is trying to calm the panic around that shot. A French hospitals official said the AstraZeneca vaccine is as effective as the Pfizer one, while Italy's health minister said vaccines are the way to end this pandemic. The Biden administration is considering sending some stockpiled AstraZeneca doses that are waiting for official approval in the US to Canada and Mexico. Despite the promising progress on vaccinations, some experts worry the US could be headed for another surge. Meantime, Brazil reported its highest daily increase of infections?since the pandemic began, a day after its daily Covid-19 death toll hit a new high.

3. China
Senior officials from the US and China are set to meet in Alaska today and tomorrow for the first time since President Biden took office. But Beijing does not?have ""high expectations,"" China's ambassador to the US said. US-China relations were tense under President Trump as the countries clashed on issues of trade, technology and human rights, and Biden's administration has signaled it would likely continue that tough stance. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently accused China of using ""coercion and aggression"" to undermine human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang (where China faces accusations of genocide against the Uyghurs). China said it wouldn't compromise on issues of the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.?

4. Amazon
""Amazon brags it pays workers above the minimum wage. What they don't tell you is what those jobs are really like."" That's one of the searing lines delivered by an Amazon warehouse employee who testified yesterday before a Senate committee. She described intense 10-hour shifts with just two 30-minute breaks that she said weren't enough to get adequate rest. Her testimony came as a milestone vote on whether Amazon workers in central Alabama should unionize is underway. The union efforts have garnered support from leaders including Biden and Stacey Abrams. Amazon, though, has waged an aggressive anti-union campaign leading up to the vote.
 
5. Winter weather
Tornadoes have hit at least five states in the Deep South as a line of storms moves through the region. The greatest damage so far appears to be in Alabama and Mississippi, where homes were damaged and roads blocked. The biggest storm threat now shifts east to Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. About 45 million are under threat for severe storms today and could see tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds. In Jackson, Mississippi, where residents have been facing a water crisis for weeks after brutal winter storms, officials finally lifted all boil water advisories.

"China says it has a 'zero-tolerance policy' for racism, but discrimination towards Africans goes back decades",18/3/2021,"They were outraged not only by widespread reports of coronavirus-related discrimination against Africans in China, but also by claims on Chinese state media that the allegations were ""groundless rumors.""
Posting under the hashtag #BlackChina, Dennis Kiplomo, a nurse from Kenya, tweeted: ""We expect the kind of hospitality we give to Chinese here in Africa, be reciprocated in their home country.""
Another user in Kenya, Peter Kariuk, wrote: ""We need a united Africa which will not be slaves of #BlackChina.""

The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou has Asia's largest African population. While the exact number of Africans living in Guangzhou is unknown, in 2017 more than 320,000 Africans entered or left China through the city, according to state news agency Xinhua.
Last month, many Africans were subject to forced coronavirus testing and arbitrary 14-day self-quarantine, regardless of their recent travel history, and scores were left homeless after being evicted by landlords and rejected by hotels under the guise of various virus containment measures.

The incident caused a rupture in China-Africa relations, with the foreign ministries of several African nations -- and even the African Union -- demanding answers from China. 
Yet China's official response stopped short of admitting that the discrimination took place -- or apologizing for it.
""All foreigners are treated equally. We reject differential treatment, and we have zero tolerance for discrimination,"" said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian. China's embassy in South Africa said in a statement: ""There is no such thing as the so-called discrimination against Africans in Guangdong province.""   
The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, went one step further, publishing an article titled: ""Who is behind the fake news of 'discrimination' against Africans in China?""
Traditionally, Beijing has portrayed racism as a Western problem. But for many Africans, whose countries have in recent years become heavily economically entwined with Beijing, the Guangzhou episode exposed the gap between the official diplomatic warmth Beijing offers African nations and the suspicion many Chinese people have for Africans themselves.
And that has been a problem for decades.   
No racism in China
The West only began really noticing -- and criticizing -- China's relationship with Africa in 2006, following a landmark summit which saw nearly every African head of state descend on Beijing. 
Yet China's ties with Africa stretch back to the 1950s, when Beijing befriended newly independent states to position itself as a leader of the developing world and to counter US and USSR power during the Cold War era. 
Beijing talked up its shared history of oppression by white imperialists, condemned South Africa's apartheid early on and gave aid to Africa even when China was a poor country. In 1968, Beijing spent the equivalent of $3 billion in today's money on constructing the Tanzam Railway in Zambia and Tanzania, and in the 1960s it began offering Africans full scholarships to Chinese universities.

The presence of African students in China was highly unusual.
Most foreigners fled China after the Communist Party came to power in 1949. When African students began arriving in significant numbers in the late 1970s, China was just beginning to open up to the world. The vast majority of people still lived in rural areas with no access to international media, and had not seen a black person outside of propaganda posters -- let alone met one. 
From the beginning, clashes were reported across the nation. 
In 1979, Africans in Shanghai were attacked for playing music too loudly, leading to 19 foreigners being hospitalized. After another fracas in 1986, this time in Beijing, 200 African students marched through the capital, shouting that Chinese claims of ""friendship were a mask for racism,"" according to a New York Times report.
''The Chinese deceived us,'' Solomon A. Tardey, of Liberia, told the newspaper. ''We know the truth now. We are going to tell our governments what the truth is.'' 
China's then Education Ministry spokesman said: ''It is the consistent and long-term policy of the Chinese government to oppose racism.""  That response was echoed nearly word for word in a statement from the Chinese government responding to the fallout in Guangzhou last month.
A race riot in China
By 1988, a total of 1,500 of the 6,000 foreign students in China were African, and had been scattered to campuses around the country -- a tactic designed to dilute racial tensions, according to a 1994 report by Michael J Sullivan in China Quarterly magazine.  
But the attempt didn't work, and on Christmas Eve that year anti-black tensions exploded in the eastern city of Nanjing, resulting in a mob of Chinese protesters running the Africans out of town. 
After, the Chinese government claimed that African students had arrived at a campus dance armed with weapons, including a knife, and beat up Chinese guards, teachers and students after being asked to register their Chinese guests, according to the Jiangsu provincial yearbook.  

The Africans maintained that when they tried to bring a Chinese friend into the dance, they were taunted with calls of ""black devil"" and a fight ensued, according to Sullivan. 
Whichever account is true, what happened after has been well documented.
Later that night, about 1,000 local students surrounded the Africans' dormitory, after rumors swept campus that they were holding a Chinese woman against her will. Chinese students lobbed bricks through their windows. 
After police broke up the scene on Christmas Day, about 70 African students decided to flee the campus and went on foot to the city train station, hoping to travel to Beijing where they had embassies. Other dark-skinned foreigners, including Americans, also fled, fearing for their safety.  
On campus, rumors spread that the Chinese hostage had died.
At 7 p.m. on Christmas Day a mob of about 8,000 students from universities across the city began marching to the railway station, carrying banners shouting ""severely punish the murderer"" and ""drive out black people."" 
As the mob closed in, police bussed out all the black students to a nearby guesthouse, where they were held until several Ghanian and Gambian students were arrested for the fight at the campus dance. 
The other Africans were bussed back to campus -- and warned not to go out at night. 
Kaiser Kuo, an American-born Chinese guitarist in the Tang Dynasty rock band, and founder of media group Sup China, was studying at Beijing University of Language and Culture that Christmas, living on a dormitory floor with students from Zambia and Liberia. He remembers hearing about the race riots. 
""They were angry with the Africans that apparently a Chinese woman's honor had been sullied,"" he said. ""This is one of the things where the rumor just kept getting inflated. By the time it reached my ears, the version was that a Chinese girl had been raped to death, when of course there was no evidence of anything like that ever happening.
""As far as I can tell, it was more like an African man had asked out a Chinese girl.""
Anti-African protests
The Nanjing event was not an outlier. In the city of Hangzhou, students claimed Africans were carriers of the AIDs virus in 1988, even though foreign students had to test negative for HIV before entering the country, wrote Barry Sautman in China Quarterly. 
Then, in January 1989, about 2,000 Beijing students boycotted classes in protest against Africans dating Chinese women -- a recurrent lightning rod issue. In Wuhan that year, posters appeared around campuses calling Africans ""black devils,"" and urging them to go home.
Kuo remembers: ""You know, all around me, there was this real concern among the African students for this kind of rising xenophobia on the college campuses.""
That created a problem for Beijing, Sautman wrote, as it undermined China's credentials as the leader of the developing world -- and the hostilities didn't go unnoticed back home.
Just as African media across the continent was outraged by the Guangzhou incident in April 2020, newspapers in Africa reacted with indignation in the 1980s. A Kenyan publication said they were not ""accidental,"" wrote Sautman. A Liberian newspaper spoke of ""yellow discrimination."" A Nigerian radio station said the Chinese students ""could not bear to see Africans"" mix with Chinese girls.  
The Chinese ambassador to the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the predecessor of the African Union, was called in to answer for what was happening in China, and the OAU secretary general called it ""apartheid in disguise."" 
Many African students left China as a result. Around the same time, China announced a reduction in interest-free loans for Africa, marking a cooling off of official relations, although ties were never broken.
Now a professor in social science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Sautman says that while the anti-African protests during the late 1980s were about race, they were also a way for Chinese students to express broader anti-government sentiment.
""The people who participated in anti-African demos then were university students, and those students were in some ways jealous of the African students,"" he says.
The Africans typically got their own room, whereas Chinese were often living eight to a dorm.
""They perceived them as living better than they did because they got subsidies from their home government and the Chinese government, and they also thought that Africans acted in a freer way than Chinese students were allowed to act,"" Sautman says.   
Is Chinese racism the same as Western racism?
As China's interaction with African people increased in the 21st century, the awkward gap between the public friendship Beijing extends and the private suspicion its citizens harbor has once again sparked moments of racial tension.
In 2009, an African-Chinese contestant on a Shanghai TV talent show received a barrage of internet abuse because of her skin color. In an opinion piece in the state-run China Daily, columnist Raymond Zhou argued that this discrimination stemmed from the fact that ""for thousands of years, those who worked outdoors (had darker skin and) were of the lower social status"" -- rather than racism.
 
""Much of China's simmering intolerance is color based. It is not an exaggeration to say many of my countrymen have a subconscious adulation of races paler than us,"" he said.
""(It seems like) outright racism, but on closer examination it's not totally race based. Many of us even look down on fellow Chinese who have darker skin, especially women. Beauty products that claim to whiten the skin always fetch a premium. And children are constantly praised for having fair skin.""
But more recent events have undermined the idea that discrimination against black people in China is not racism.  
In 2016, a Chinese detergent maker sparked international outrage over an advertisement that showed a black man being washed whiter in order to woo an Asian woman. A spokesperson for the company said Western media was being ""too sensitive.""
The following year, a museum in the city of Wuhan apologized for presenting an exhibition that juxtaposed images of African people and wild African animals making similar facial expressions. Then, in 2018, the annual gala for national broadcaster CCTV drew ire after a Chinese woman appeared in black face.
In Africa, where it is estimated more than 1 million Chinese people now live, there have been repeated reports of Chinese restaurateurs setting up establishments that ban Africans.
""There is a classic discussion over whether Chinese racism is racist in the way it's envisioned in the West or Europe, or is it a different kind of discriminatory policy,"" says Winslow Robertson, founder of Cowries and Rice, a China-Africa management consultancy. 
""My sense is that it is racism. Is it identical to what we see in the US coming out of chattel slavery? No. But if you define racism as based on something you can't change about yourself, then yes it is racism.""
Discrimination against Africans in China during the coronavirus pandemic, he adds, has exposed that fact.
Earlier this month, in a bid to head off those criticisms, officials in Guangdong announced new measures to combat racial discrimination, including setting up a hotline for foreign nationals. The notice said that shops, hospitals, restaurants and residential communities -- the places where Africans had been targeted -- should offer ""strictly offer equal services.""

But Paul Mensah, a Ghanian trader who has been living in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen for five years, says the treatment of Africans in China during the Covid-19 pandemic has shaped his perceptions of racial attitudes in the country.
""I thought racism was inherent in America but I never thought people in China would do this,"" says Mensah. ""Before when they (Chinese people) would see a black person, they would touch your skin and touch your hair, and I thought it was out of curiosity because a lot of them don't travel. But this is racism and there is no punishment for it.""  
Sautman, who wrote the paper on the Nanjing riot, says that if China is serious about eliminating the maltreatment of foreigners, it should punish those who mete out racial abuse and discrimination.
Article 4 of China's constitution stipulates that ""all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China are equal ... discrimination and oppression of any ethnic group is prohibited. It is forbidden to undermine ethnic unity and create ethnic divisions."" 
But there have been no reports of people in Guangzhou being held accountable for their actions against Africans, and the constitution has had little effect in protecting China's own ethnic minorities. It is estimated that 2 million of China's Uyghur minority are being held reeducation camps in the northwest of the country. 
Without an enforced legal deterrent, Sautman says it will be hard to change the way Chinese people treat Africans. ""There's not a place in the world where racial discrimination has been diminished without taking those actions,"" he says.
","A black version of the Chinese flag swept across African Twitter earlier this month, as users replaced their avatars to express their anger at the government of China.  They were outraged not only by widespread reports of coronavirus-related discrimination against Africans in China, but also by claims on Chinese state media that the allegations were ""groundless rumors."" Posting under the hashtag #BlackChina, Dennis Kiplomo, a nurse from Kenya, tweeted: ""We expect the kind of hospitality we give to Chinese here in Africa, be reciprocated in their home country.""

""Much of China's simmering intolerance is color based. It is not an exaggeration to say many of my countrymen have a subconscious adulation of races paler than us,"" he said. ""(It seems like) outright racism, but on closer examination it's not totally race based. Many of us even look down on fellow Chinese who have darker skin, especially women.

"There have been at least 10 suspected hate crimes against Asians this year in New York City, police say",18/3/2021,"The information highlights the recent spate of anti-Asian incidents felt in cities nationwide, coinciding with the Covid-19 pandemic that began last year.
In 2020, there were 29 reported racially-motivated crimes against people of Asian descent in New York City, and 24 of those were attributed to ""coronavirus motivation,"" according to NYPD data. Racially motivated crimes against people of Asian descent in 2019 totaled three.

The NYPD says it has increased its presence around predominantly Asian communities and placed Critical Response Command teams throughout the city in light of the shootings on Tuesday in the Atlanta area that left eight people dead -- six of them, Asian women. Authorities in Georgia are not calling the shootings a hate crime at this point and pointed to potential claims the suspect made that he has a sex addiction.

Three recent possible hate crimes are under investigation
Several recent incidents in New York are being investigated as possible hate crimes by the NYPD's Hate Crime Task Force and Asian Hate Crime Task Force, according to police.

Just before 7 p.m. on Monday, a man in his 20's approached a 41-year-old Asian woman at Eighth Avenue and West 37th Avenue in Midtown NYC, according to the NYPD.
The man poured a liquid on the woman's neck and the packages she was carrying, according to the police. The woman claims the man told her to ""go back to China"" before he left the scene.
The woman, who was uninjured, reported the attack to the NYPD, police confirmed. The NYPD Asian Hate Crime Task Force is investigating the incident.

In another incident on Sunday, a 25-year-old woman told the NYPD she was waiting to cross the street near East 22nd Street and First Avenue when a female suspect approached her and said, ""you aren't from around here ... go back to China"" which the victim told police made her ""fearful for her safety"" and caused ""annoyance and alarm."" 
Then, the same suspect told a 31-year-old man to ""Go back to communist China"" which caused him to feel ""annoyed harassed and alarmed,"" police told CNN. The NYPD Hate Crime Task Force is investigating this incidents.
The NYPD additionally reported an incident on February 15 when a 27-year-old man says he was pushed by an unknown individual while heading to his car.

Court dates set for two Canadians detained in China on espionage charges,18/3/2021,"In a statement Thursday, Canada's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Marc Garneau, said the country's embassy in Beijing ""has been notified that court hearings for Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig are scheduled to take place on March 19 and March 22, respectively."" 
The two Canadians have been detained since December 2018 and were charged in June last year with spying.
Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat who worked for the International Crisis Group (ICG), is accused by the Chinese authorities of ""stealing sensitive information and intelligence through contacts in China since 2017,"" while Spavor, a businessman based in Beijing with a focus on North Korea, is accused of providing intelligence to Kovrig.
Chinese officials have not disclosed any evidence against the two men or information detailing their alleged crimes, but have said, ""the facts are clear and evidence is solid.""
The two men were detained following the arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei, over allegations the company violated United States sanctions on Iran. Meng -- whose extradition hearing is currently ongoing -- has been held under house arrest in Vancouver since 2018.
Spavor's trial will be taking place as US and Chinese officials are meeting in Alaska, the first time such high level discussions have taken place since Joe Biden became president. 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who will be representing Washington at the meeting, has previously spoken out in support of the two Canadians, calling for them to be released ""immediately and unconditionally."" 
'Political' prosecution
Family members and contacts of the two Canadian men have described them being held in poor conditions, and denied outside contact. Almost all in-person consular visits to foreign prisoners in China have been paused since last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, with diplomats only able to speak to those detained via the phone. 
After Kovrig and Spavor were charged with espionage last year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau denounced the ""political"" nature of their case, saying their detention was a ""decision made by the Chinese government and we deplore it.""

Trudeau has repeatedly refused to consider any trade of the two Canadians for Meng, whose detention has seen relations plunge between Ottawa and Beijing. Last month, Canada's parliament approved a non-binding motion accusing China of committing genocide against its Muslim minorities in the western region of Xinjiang, further straining ties between the two countries.
In his statement Thursday, Garneau said Canada believes the detention of Kovrig and Spavor ""are arbitrary, and remain deeply troubled by the lack of transparency surrounding these proceedings.""
""Canadian officials are seeking continued consular access to Mr. Spavor and Mr. Kovrig, in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the China-Canada Consular Agreement, and have also requested to attend the proceedings,"" he added. ""Canadian officials will continue to provide consular support to these men and their families during this unacceptable ordeal."" 
Both the administrations of former US President Donald Trump, and now US President Joe Biden have pledged to do all they can to assist the two Canadians, with Vice President Kamala Harris telling Trudeau in a phone call in February that Washington was in ""strong solidarity with Canada regarding the issue of two Canadian citizens unjustly detained by China.""

China's ambassador to US says he doesn't have 'high expectations' for Alaska summit with Biden officials,18/3/2021,"China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and State Councilor Wang Yi will meet with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Thursday and Friday in Anchorage, Alaska. 
There is no public agenda for the event, but a spokesman for the US State Department said ""a range of issues"" would be discussed. ""We will certainly not pull any punches in discussing our areas of disagreement,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said on March 11.
The summit follows a protracted deterioration in relations between Beijing and Washington under former US President Donald Trump, including the imposition of trade sanctions, mutual visa restrictions and technology bans.
Speaking Wednesday in Alaska, Cui Tiankai, China's ambassador to the US, said the Chinese government didn't ""expect to solve all problems in one dialogue."" 
""We don't have high expectations or fantasy,"" said Cui. ""I think both sides attach great importance to it. We have done a lot in preparation in the past few days."" 
While the Chinese government has said it hoped the two countries could ""meet halfway,"" the White House has signaled it would likely continue the tough stance laid out by the previous administration.
Speaking in Japan Wednesday, Blinken accused China of using ""coercion and aggression"" to undermine human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, and assert its claims to Taiwan and the South China Sea. 
On the same day, the US announced a decision to sanction 24 Hong Kong and Chinese officials in response to new restrictions on democracy in Hong Kong that will further curb the right of people in the city to stand for election.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said the country has taken countermeasures against the US decision. When asked if Beijing would take further action, Cui replied, ""With the situation evolving, we will continue to do if necessary.""
Cui said in talks with the US representatives, China would not compromise on key issues related to the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

""The prerequisite for dialogue and communication between any countries is that both sides should have the spirit of equality and mutual respect,"" he said.
""I hope both parties will come with sincerity and leave with a better understanding of each other.""
Thursday's meeting between the two sides is due to take place at the same time as the trial of Canadian businessman Michael Spavor, who has been held in custody in China since December 2018.

Intelligence report contradicts claims by Trump and his team on China election interference,18/3/2021,"The report also raises questions about the effort from Senate Republicans to investigate the Bidens and Ukraine, a probe that examined many of the same allegations about the Bidens and Ukraine that the Russian-linked officials were pushing, according to the intelligence community report.
The report, compiled by the US intelligence community and declassified and released by Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines on Tuesday, assessed that the Russian government meddled in the 2020 election with an influence campaign ""denigrating"" President Joe Biden and ""supporting"" Trump. In addition, the report said China did not interfere and ""considered but did not deploy influence efforts intended to change the outcome of the US Presidential election.""  
That assessment flies in the face of the public comments from Trump and members of his administration, including former Attorney General William Barr and former national security adviser Robert O'Brien who helped push Trump's narrative that China was interfering in the election more aggressively than Russia or Iran.
CNN previously reported that Trump decried any suggestion that Russia posed an equally dangerous threat as China as equivalent to the partisan ""witch hunt"" against him -- a view that was factored into the messaging of administration officials, who focused their public comments on Beijing and downplayed Moscow's actions. 
A whistleblower also previously accused top Trump political appointees in the Department of Homeland Security of instructing career officials to ""cease providing intelligence assessments on the threat of Russian interference in the US and instead start reporting on interference activities by China and Iran,"" according to the documents obtained by CNN.
That order came from O'Brien, according to the complaint. 
The new report rebuts many of the claims Trump and his allies made surrounding foreign interference and the election, where Trump and administration officials repeatedly downplayed the threat of Russian election interference while Trump's allies such as Rudy Giuliani worked with Russian-linked Ukrainians to try to dig up dirt on Biden. 
While the intelligence report didn't mention Giuliani by name, it includes a detailed accounting of how Russian-linked officials sought to damage Biden's campaign by providing materials to US officials in an attempt to implicate the Bidens ""in allegedly corrupt activities related to Ukraine.""  
""The primary effort the IC (intelligence community) uncovered revolved around a narrative -- that Russian actors began spreading as early as 2014 -- alleging corrupt ties between President Biden, his family, and other US officials and Ukraine,"" the report says. 
Those same Russian-linked allegations involving the Bidens and Ukraine were taken up in a Senate GOP investigation led by then-Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson. As part of his probe, Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, sought to subpoena and cited a Ukrainian official, Andrii Telizhenko, whom the Treasury Department says was connected to Andriy Derkach, one of the key officials the intelligence community assessed was part of Russia's election interference efforts.  
Johnson and Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, released their report two months before the election criticizing Hunter Biden's financial dealings in Ukraine and other countries, like China. At the time, Democrats accused Johnson of receiving information that was part of a Russian disinformation campaign, which Johnson and Grassley repeatedly denied. 
'I believe it's China'
For top Trump administration officials, foreign election interference was all about China. 
Asked in September which country had been most assertive in interfering in the election, Barr told CNN's Wolf Blitzer: ""I believe it's China."" 
During the same interview, Barr also went out of his way to dilute the intelligence community's assessment that Russia was again actively interfering in a US election. 
""I accept that there is some preliminary activity that suggests that they might try again,"" he said of Russia. ""It wouldn't surprise me if Russia tries something again of the same general genre before."" 
It's not clear what US intelligence had assessed about China's potential election interference at the time of Barr's interview with CNN in September.
Asked this week about his previous comments and the new report, Barr said his response in the CNN interview related to the broader national security threat from China, which the previous and current administrations agree is the most serious. ""China has much more formidable capabilities. I was looking at things broadly,"" Barr said.
Days after Barr's interview last year, O'Brien said that he agreed ""100%"" with Barr's assertion that China was being more aggressive with its attempts to influence the 2020 election than other malign actors, including Russia, but offered little evidence to back up the claim. 
""What the intelligence community has made very clear,"" O'Brien told reporters at the time, ""first you have China, which has the most massive program to influence the United States politically, you have Iran and you have Russia. These are all three adversary countries that are seeking to disrupt our elections."" 
""Some of them prefer Biden; some people say some of them prefer the President,"" he had said, notably sounding certain that some had been pushing for Biden but casting some level of doubt on whether some were pushing for Trump.  
Those comments last year by O'Brien and Barr underscore how Trump and his allies often blurred the line between broader national security concerns -- that China was engaged in a long-term strategy to shape US policy -- and allegations that China was actively meddling in the election, a distinction that is reaffirmed in the report released Tuesday. 
While the report also notes a ""minority view"" that some intelligence officials have ""moderate"" confidence that China took ""at least some steps"" to hurt Trump's candidacy, it does not offer any evidence to support what the former President and some of his allies were claiming prior to the election.  
Intel officials says China is a threat but report says it did not interfere in the election
Intelligence officials have long warned that China poses a grave national security threat and is engaged in a highly sophisticated malign foreign influence campaign against the US, but the report released Tuesday highlights a key distinction between the broader threat posed by Beijing and claims of targeted election interference. 
Trump's former intelligence chief, John Ratcliffe, repeatedly conflated the two issues when asked about Beijing's election interference activity, pushing claims that aligned more closely with comments made by Barr and O'Brien than assessments from election security officials. 
""I can't get into a whole lot of details, other than to say that China is using a massive and sophisticated influence campaign that dwarfs anything that any other country is doing,"" Ratcliffe claimed during an August interview with Fox News. 
Prior to leaving his post, Ratcliffe said he supported the ""minority view"" on China that was cited in Tuesday's report, according to a letter that was attached to the classified version sent to Congress and obtained by CNN. 
""Similar actions by Russia and China are assessed and communicated to policymakers differently, potentially leading to the false impression that Russia sought to influence the election but China did not,"" he wrote, citing a report by the intelligence community Ombudsman which found that analysts were inconsistent in how they defined the terms ""influence"" and ""interference"" when referring to China and Russia.   
Republicans were also raising concerns about China's influence efforts targeting Americans prior to the election, but several sources familiar with briefings provided to lawmakers told CNN at the time that intelligence officials had not presented clear evidence showing Beijing is actively interfering in the election or taking specific steps to boost one candidate over the other. 
Instead, intelligence and election security officials focused, both privately and publicly, on the holistic threat posed by China, emphasizing that Beijing employs a variety of ""malign tactics"" that could have implications on the 2020 race. 
And while the intelligence community initially assessed that China preferred Trump to lose in November, a finding that Trump often used to justify his politically driven narrative, it ultimately concluded that Beijing did not favor one candidate over the other, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence report released Tuesday. 
""China sought stability in its relationship with the United States and did not view either election outcome as advantageous enough for China to risk blowback if caught,"" it says. ""We assess that Beijing also believes there is a bipartisan consensus against China in the United States that leaves no prospect for a pro-China administration regardless of the election outcome."" 
Russian-linked Ukrainians pushed misinformation to Trump allies
Tuesday's report assesses that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed Russia's interference campaign. It cites both Konstantin Kilimnik and Andriy Derkach as two Ukrainian-linked officials who were part of the Russian interference efforts. The US intelligence report says that Putin ""had purview over the activities"" of Derkach.  
""Derkach, Kilimnik, and their associates sought to use prominent US persons and media conduits to launder their narratives to US officials and audiences. These Russian proxies met with and provided materials to Trump administration-linked US persons to advocate for formal investigations; hired a US firm to petition US officials; and attempted to make contact with several senior US officials,"" the report says. 
The report doesn't name Giuliani, but it references his efforts to dig up dirt on Biden in Ukraine, according to a source familiar with the report. Giuliani's efforts included work with Derkach and another official, Telizhenko, who played a role in the Senate GOP investigation into the Bidens. 
The September report released by Johnson and Grassley detailing the findings of their Biden probe was critical of Hunter Biden's financial dealings and his work on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm, though it did not accuse Joe Biden of wrongdoing.   
As part of that investigation, Johnson sought to subpoena Telizhenko to obtain records about his work with a public affairs firm that contracted with Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company. Johnson ultimately scrapped the subpoena amid resistance from committee members, although Telizhenko is referenced in the GOP report more than 100 times -- including a section criticizing the Obama administration for their connections to him.
Grassley spokesman Taylor Foy said their report with Johnson ""relied on Obama-era US government records and information from a Democrat-aligned US lobby shop, which employed Telizhenko."" Their report, he said, did not rely on any information from Derkach.
""The FBI and members of the IC indicated last year that there was no reason for the committee's investigation to be halted, even with knowledge of Telizhenko's limited involvement,"" Foy said.
Telizhenko was not referenced in Tuesday's intelligence report. But he was sanctioned by the Treasury Department in January under the Trump administration for being ""part of a Russia-linked foreign influence network associated with Andrii Derkach.""  
The Senate Intelligence Committee's bipartisan report on election interference released last year said that Telizhenko ""participated in a documentary film that aired on a US news channel"" attacking the Bidens over Ukraine in January 2020 -- the same time frame as a documentary cited in the US intelligence report as part of Russia's election interference. 
Democrats charged last year that information from entities with ties to Russia, including Derkach, was provided to Johnson and others as part of a disinformation campaign. 
Telizhenko has accused Democrats of a ""smear campaign"" against him. Johnson has insisted he was not part of any Russian disinformation campaign, accusing Democrats of spreading disinformation by leveling the accusations against him. 
""We have neither sought out, relied upon, nor publicly released anything that could even remotely be considered disinformation,"" Johnson and Grassley wrote in a letter to Democratic leaders last August.

Prior to leaving his post, Ratcliffe said he supported the ""minority view"" on China that was cited in Tuesday's report, according to a letter that was attached to the classified version sent to Congress and obtained by CNN.  ""Similar actions by Russia and China are assessed and communicated to policymakers differently, potentially leading to the false impression that Russia sought to influence the election but China did not,"" he wrote, citing a report by the intelligence community Ombudsman which found that analysts were inconsistent in how they defined the terms ""influence"" and ""interference"" when referring to China and Russia.    Republicans were also raising concerns about China's influence efforts targeting Americans prior to the election, but several sources familiar with briefings provided to lawmakers told CNN at the time that intelligence officials had not presented clear evidence showing Beijing is actively interfering in the election or taking specific steps to boost one candidate over the other.  Instead, intelligence and election security officials focused, both privately and publicly, on the holistic threat posed by China, emphasizing that Beijing employs a variety of ""malign tactics"" that could have implications on the 2020 race.  And while the intelligence community initially assessed that China preferred Trump to lose in November, a finding that Trump often used to justify his politically driven narrative, it ultimately concluded that Beijing did not favor one candidate over the other, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence report released Tuesday.  ""China sought stability in its relationship with the United States and did not view either election outcome as advantageous enough for China to risk blowback if caught,"" it says. ""We assess that Beijing also believes there is a bipartisan consensus against China in the United States that leaves no prospect for a pro-China administration regardless of the election outcome.""  Russian-linked Ukrainians pushed misinformation to Trump allies Tuesday's report assesses that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed Russia's interference campaign. It cites both Konstantin Kilimnik and Andriy Derkach as two Ukrainian-linked officials who were part of the Russian interference efforts. The US intelligence report says that Putin ""had purview over the activities"" of Derkach.   ""Derkach, Kilimnik, and their associates sought to use prominent US persons and media conduits to launder their narratives to US officials and audiences. These Russian proxies met with and provided materials to Trump administration-linked US persons to advocate for formal investigations; hired a US firm to petition US officials; and attempted to make contact with several senior US officials,"" the report says.  The report doesn't name Giuliani, but it references his efforts to dig up dirt on Biden in Ukraine, according to a source familiar with the report. Giuliani's efforts included work with Derkach and another official, Telizhenko, who played a role in the Senate GOP investigation into the Bidens.  The September report released by Johnson and Grassley detailing the findings of their Biden probe was critical of Hunter Biden's financial dealings and his work on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm, though it did not accuse Joe Biden of wrongdoing.    As part of that investigation, Johnson sought to subpoena Telizhenko to obtain records about his work with a public affairs firm that contracted with Burisma, the Ukrainian e",politics,POLITICS
To be an Asian woman in America,18/3/2021,"I don't know the victims' names. The name of the shooter was quickly released Tuesday night and was on people's minds Wednesday more than his victims. We've learned from news reports that he told police he killed these women out of ""revenge"" -- that he was a sex addict who wanted the ""temptation"" of these massage spas to go away. 
The police say the shooter told them that  this mass killing was not racially motivated. But it's clear that the people he targeted were Asian women -- he allegedly went to places where he knew Asian women would be and shot them. And Asians across the United States, women and men, are understandably terrified. 
Let me share what I know about what it means to be an Asian woman in the US, especially in the South, a place that, until very recently, I called home for nearly 20 years. 
To be an Asian woman in America means you can't just be what you are: a fully enfranchised human being. It means you are a blank screen on which others project their stories, especially, too often, their sexualized fantasies -- because US culture has long presented Asian women as sexualized objects for White male enjoyment. 
This happened when Chinese immigrant women first came to the US in the 19th century, kidnapped or bought for sale in China and shipped to America, or tricked into sexual servitude when the domestic worker jobs they were promised disappeared and the only job they could get was to have sex with men for money. They did not get to keep the money. That went to the men who bound them, sometimes in cages -- forcing them to have sex with men. Many of these women died of disease, malnourishment, and abuse without being released from their sexual servitude --that's the founding story of Asian women in America. 
To be an Asian woman in America means hearing men, especially white men, try to tell you their war stories from Korea, Vietnam and sometimes the Middle East. I have been approached numerous times by white male veterans in the South asking me if I was either Korean or Vietnamese. When I tell them I'm Chinese American, they are disappointed but still tell me about their Asian war stories and how I remind them of these Korean or Vietnamese women they once knew. I always extricate myself from these conversations as soon as possible. 
That strangers think it is OK to monopolize my time  this way speaks volumes about how White men treat Asian women in US society -- as objects to be their sounding board as they work through war trauma and as living reminders of the Asian women they left behind, with the unspoken stories of sexual exploits lingering in the air.
To be an Asian woman in America, working in a place called Youngs Asian Massage -- as several of the shooting victims were -- means having men assume you are a sex worker, that you are not what you are: a human being worthy of dignity and respect like every other person. 
To be an Asian woman working in a place like this during the pandemic means you have serious financial concerns -- you can't work safely from home; you have to earn tips in the service industry; you have to put up with abuse from customers because in America the customer is always right, especially when that customer is a man. 
To be an Asian woman working in the US South in the massage industry means being an object, not a subject; being neither Black nor White and thus seen to have honorary white status, which in practice conveys a false belief that you aren't subject to White supremacy; being invisible except when you have been killed by a white man who claims it's not his fault -- it's his addiction. It means further disappearing: being one of six women killed in what people aren't even calling a racially motivated crime, although can there be any doubt that it was misogyny and toxic masculinity that killed you?
What can we do? What can YOU do? Do not look away. These are not one-off stories. There is a whole history of sexualized violence against Asian women in America. 
Learn about the history of Asian Americans. 
Take a Hollaback Bystander training so that all women, including Asian women, don't have to feel so afraid and vulnerable. 
Treat Asian American women as what they are instead of the stereotypes and racialized sexual fantasies they've been portrayed as for far too long. We are fully enfranchised human beings -- just like you -- who demand and deserve respect and dignity as we live our lives.
","Last night, just like the rest of the world, I watched news reports of the Atlanta shootings. I saw images of Atlanta businesses, the photo of a young white man, and the sensational headlines. It's now been confirmed that eight people were shot dead, six of them Asian women.  I don't know the victims' names. The name of the shooter was quickly released Tuesday night and was on people's minds Wednesday more than his victims.
